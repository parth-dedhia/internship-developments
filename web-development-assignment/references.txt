Problems faced :

During Development : 
Ajax call from javascript had been removed and had to find a way around the same.

During Deployment :
The project name under which I was deploying was already taken and took a lot of time and had to change manage.py, wsgi and setting.py file. That took a little while. The rest of the deployment steps are taken from the above link.
