15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"12,May,2004","the history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan.   seitan (say-tahn) is made from gluten. gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic. known as seitan in japan, as kofu in china, and as ""wheat meat"" and ""gluten"" here in the u.s., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute. it has been eaten in china, japan, korea, russia and the middle east for thousands of years. gluten is often referred to in chinese restaurants as ""buddha food"", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian buddhist monks as a meat substitute. it is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition.   as a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of b vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. a 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat. the same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats. as recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement.   another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this. most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce). if you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon). moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes.   many vegetarians' first experience with eating gluten is at chinese or vietnamese restaurants, where it's called ""mock duck"", ""mock chicken"", etc. when it's sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it's called seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word ""gluten"" lacks consumer appeal. it stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too ""meaty."" however, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, wheat meat"" is growing in popularity.   seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency. the dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop. next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran. what is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu. when raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it's called ""seitan"".   it is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat. it can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried. each version yields a different texture. oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering. baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan. pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture. fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well.    - written by alyx sandborg, copyright 2002 by pagewise, inc"

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"06,May,2004","hosted by kim o'donnel washingtonpost.com staff writer thursday, april 29, 2004; 12:00 pm  released may 5, 2004  a graduate of peter kump's new york cooking school, kim spends much of her time in front of the stove or with her nose in a cookbook.   the transcript follows.   editor's note: washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over live online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.   ________________________________________________   kim o'donnel: hello out there. it's been a while since our last get-together. for those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last thursday on the month. since we last discussed, i came across a fun piece on yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: ""flexatarian."" i think that would aptly describe my eating habits. interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. so, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. onward...   _______________________   i'm a goin veggie huntin....: kim!; two questions: first, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? second, what great things should i look for at the farmers market this saturday morning?    kim o'donnel: the nice people at arlington courthouse have been very patient with me as i've not gotten my act together on setting a date. it'll be sometime in may or june, probably june. funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on wtop this morning was all about my finds last weekend. think green, kids. it's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!   _______________________   frederick, md.: i'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. however, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (my goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)   kim o'donnel: there is a vegetarian cooking school in new york city that has a good reputation. name escapes me at the moment; it might be natural cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. check out shawguides.com   _______________________   st. paul, minn.: my two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. i don't think he gets enough calcium. any suggestions? and can you tell me how to make a smoothie? after i make one, how long can i leave it in the refrigerator?   kim o'donnel: lentils are loaded with calcium. spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: i prefer with yogurt, and to it, i add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. i don't add ice or juice because i like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour.   _______________________   arlington, va.: hi kim. just got back from new orleans and while i made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, i'd love to make my own. any suggestions? i'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe?   kim o'donnel: i think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the gimme lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra!   _______________________   prince frederick, md.: can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of sherpas in tibet. most of what i've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. i want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. i still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.   i can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet. but what really turned me off about meat was reading ""fast food nation."" it revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. i recommend everyone read it, as well as ""the jungle"" by upton sinclair.   kim o'donnel: prince,  vegetarian cookbooks have come a long way from the days of co-ops and communes...there are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. immediately what comes to mind are titles by deborah madison, jeanne lemlin and then there's crescent dragonwagon's ""passionate vegetarian"", loads of titles by robin robertson...and all of them are very contemporary.   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hi kim,   my husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. any ideas as to what it is?  thanks a bunch!   kim o'donnel: the green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. this is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. you can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, really well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta...   _______________________   virginia: does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? i am looking for big pieces, not something that is ""ground."" i have tried a couple of things without much luck. thanks!   kim o'donnel: many looking for similar products like the taste of quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?   _______________________   anonymous: i have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk. they sell it at whole foods.   kim o'donnel: thanks for chiming in...that's what i was thinking...   _______________________   silver spring, md.: for meatless jambalaya, i'd use tempeh, i like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. some seitan might be good for texture also.   kim o'donnel: ah, bueno. thanks, silver!   _______________________   reston, va.: i'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but i hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref. northern va)?   kim o'donnel: yes, yes, yes!  arlington courthouse, on saturday mornings.  dupont circle and takoma park, sunday mornings.    _______________________   veggie burger: i've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it. can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? not lentils, please (ewww...)   kim o'donnel: a few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. since then, i made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. i did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but i gotta get you the details. i don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after i look through my papers at home...   _______________________   arlington, va.: we like to eat morning star farms ""chik nuggets"" - they also come in patties. my son particularly likes to have this when friends who ""hate"" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something not chicken.   kim o'donnel: thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, arlington.   _______________________   east falls church, va.: hi, kim!   you mentioned last chat (tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. i presume you peel it first, but i, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).   thanks!   kim o'donnel: hey efc,  yeah, i cut off what i need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m&p. works really well, and no, you do get what you need.   _______________________   dupont circle, washington, d.c.: for your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school . . . yes, it's called the natural  gourmet cookery school  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in new york city.  they also do dinners open to the public on most  friday evenings. sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.   kim o'donnel: hey, thanks for following up!   _______________________   new york, n.y.: kim,   i need fruit help. i feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right? what should i look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? i'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when i all really want is to stop at kripsy kreme!;   thanks!;   kim o'donnel: it is a tough time for fruit. i was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi...   _______________________   re: low fat veggie cookbook: moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes many more things than what sherpas would eat. it has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.   kim o'donnel: thanks for reminding me...my moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use.   _______________________   for reston looking for farmers market in nova:: the falls church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings   kim o'donnel: great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader.   _______________________   alexandria, va.: hi kim!   when you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the alexandria farmers' market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. it's open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every saturday.   kim o'donnel: very glad that you've reminded me, alexandria.   _______________________   virginia: i am so excited, i just have to share. for years, i have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in indian restaurants, but the ones i made were never as good. i finally found the secret: rosewater. you only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. also, the frozen mango chunks from trader joe's make lassi-making very easy, and i find the quality to be very good. i have been drinking them every day this week!   kim o'donnel: funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing.   _______________________   silver spring, md.: hi kim -  i have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... i've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy.   i'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it. do you have any ideas?   love your chats - you rock!   kim o'donnel: squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, silver. some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. sounds nice.   _______________________   arlington, va.: hi kim, i want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? would i cook the tofu at all before adding it in? i'm not sure where to start...   thanks!!   kim o'donnel: do you want to do coconut milk curry? talk to me.   _______________________   arlington, va.: hi kim,  white bean bruschetta - i tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients - & i  bought the wrong kind of beans. here's  what i came up with so far - what am i  missing (or how can i vary it)?   tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil   kim o'donnel: the beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in italy, bruschetta are among the many ""salatini"" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. you can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt. lemon zest is great. rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry...   _______________________   fairfax, va: kim,   my wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and i'm a happy meat eater. i'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but i'd like to do it on the grill. what can i cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (and how do i do it)?   thanks!;   kim o'donnel: you can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. serve over rice. you, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs...   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hi kim,  speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on thursdays in penn quarter (i think it was on 7th and e maybe?) is it coming back? do you know when? it was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...  thanks!   kim o'donnel: yes, it is. starting next thursday, may 6, from 3 to 7.   _______________________   bethesda, md.: hello-  do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? preferably in md. thanks   kim o'donnel: weekend section usually does an annual list which i'm betting will come out next month. anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?   _______________________   rockville, md.: my favorite italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. in making this at home would you recommend the ""plain old salted"" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...   kim o'donnel: plain, unsalted. you got it...   _______________________   vegetarian pigs in a blanket: does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? i am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. thanks!;   kim o'donnel: i'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc...   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hey kim, a quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? i'm trying to cut back on sugar, so i'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. thanks   kim o'donnel: making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil...   _______________________   soy bechamel?: any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? there's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the march cooking light that i'd like to modify. thanks   kim o'donnel: chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work. i don't know for sure. my copy of ""dairy-free cooking"" offers some ""cream sauce"" ideas...so why not??   _______________________   vege in fairfax, va.: to the question about paneer from the what's cooking chat. one can drain it in cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. keep in a cold place overnite. remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.  actually mango lassi is not very common in india. lassi is usually salty. i just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. yummy  try cardamon in your mango lassi for the extra zing!   kim o'donnel: thanks, fairfax...great tidbits...i'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis...   _______________________   st. louis, mo.: another cookbook suggestion: i started out veggie with the ""horn of the moon"" cookbook by ginny callan. many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. a follow-up book, ""beyond the moon,"" includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) worth a look.   kim o'donnel: not familiar with this one, st. lou. thanks for the tidbit...   _______________________   suitland, md.: does anyone know of a good soy cheese brand? something that actually tastes like cheese? i am looking for a block that i can grate.   thanks!!   kim o'donnel: who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???   _______________________   washington, d.c.: hi kim!; i have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. i have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. i was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? thanks!;   kim o'donnel: blanching them does help bring them along, washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea....   _______________________   bethesda, md.: hello kim-  i have an eggplant question for you. i generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that i really, really love it. i know it is simple but can't figure it out. i usually have it as antipasto in italian restaurants or when i was in italy. it is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. i don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. can you help me? thanks   kim o'donnel: eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, bethesda. was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? do tell...   _______________________   boston, mass.: hi kim,   what can i do with broccoli besides steam it?  thanks!   kim o'donnel: i like roasting it, at 500 degrees. but first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. it's a great treat!   _______________________   indian head, md.: hi kim! my new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. i am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.   they are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!   j   kim o'donnel: let's see...i'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander...   _______________________   washington, d.c.: my special someone has a birthday coming up and i wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that i could try and use?   kim o'donnel: spectacular and vegetarian...i'm thinking of a curry. i've got an interesting idea for a thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but i think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest...   _______________________   oxford, miss: i'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but i'm getting bored with my recipe. do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?   kim o'donnel: do you make a sofrito for your r& b? you know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...i'd also add a chopped fresh chile...   _______________________   reston, va.: good morning kim. still struggling with the white sweet potatos. any ideas?   thanks!   kim o'donnel: not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...i'd roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest...   _______________________   herndon, va.: oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my  marinate recall has lapsed  please advise with some great basics for  marinating - i'm specifically thinking of the  little mushrooms and zucchini i bought  yesterday for bbq skewers, but a good  marinate could work on most foods...   also, any hints on grilling veg on  skewers?  thanks in advance   kim o'donnel: salt really well. use a brush. olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size...   _______________________   reston, va: hooray for the mention of the alexandria farmers'  market. my great-grandfather sold there every  saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad  tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early  to go to market. there are also lots of stories about  my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that  were packed on friday...   kim o'donnel: nice story, reston. thanks for the memories...   _______________________   re: strawberry picking: butler's orchard, in germantown (md). you can call their phone line to find out what's available when.   kim o'donnel: excellent!   _______________________   laurel, md: chiming in:   rice and beans: i've been planning a reverse black beans  and white rice using white beans and some of the black  rice, seasoned with a south-east asian theme.   kim o'donnel: ooh...i like that...   _______________________   dallas, texas - arugala: hi kim.  wanted to share a great sauce recipe. i sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions. let it all cook together till the sauce thickens. i served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta. at the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe. very healthy and delicious. and with all the flavors, you won't miss the meat.   ~chef in training   kim o'donnel: very nice indeed, dallas. keep sending reports of your experiments!   _______________________   washington, dc: this may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans? i.e. does the can say ""white beans"" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? thanks for the insight.   kim o'donnel: white beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and great northern beans. they are interchangeable.   _______________________   adams morgan: how does one make a white bean spread?   kim o'donnel: a can of drained white beans. whiz in a food processor. olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. taste. lemon zest is nice, too. taste. add more seasoning if needed. taste for smoothness, too. you're good to go.   _______________________   arlington, va: hi,   i hope you can help me. i have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. the only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if i grind up veggies inside dumplings. i tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in fear factor eating worms. i think it's a texture thing. do you have any suggestions?   kim o'donnel: take her to the farm market this weekend. introduce her to a farmer. let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. let me know how it goes...   _______________________   kim o'donnel: out of time, folks. thanks for all the good stuff. take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! the air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! promise to be back for end of may, and in meatime, join me for the regular tuesday free for all..best to you.   _______________________    â© 2004 washingtonpost.newsweek interactive"
15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"06,May,2004","by jessica rae patton, may 7 2004  i recently spent the weekend in chicago, the city of encased meat. just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there.  at hot doug's, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks.  but there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro. because the fact is, although i'm a vegan, i'm a fool for fake meat. or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside french fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands. these food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine. but i guess because chicago's a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as studs terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions. i, for one, thank doug and his colleagues for this. that was one damn good dog. char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll.  i returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that i might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts. i dragged my boyfriend, art, along to taste-test the real ones.  i f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu. at the original swanky frank's, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic i-95 on-ramp, the owner, bob, snorted, ""that would be sacrilegious.""  ""but i was in chicago, and--""  ""this isn't chicago, is it?"" he said and walked away. was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general? maybe i was naã¯ve to the subversive nature of soy protein. and here i just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub.  i sat on a rickety stool and ordered french fries and blathered on about writing a food review. the fry cook, who looked like billy bob thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can't write a food review if all you eat is french fries. these guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down. their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in.  in all fairness, our server at the swankier of the swankies, in westport, was super-friendly.

""it makes the texture crackly, not snappy.""  ""snappy?""  ""yeah, some hot dogs are snappy. the skin won't give right away when you bite it, then it snaps.""  he also liked that the raw onions were self-serve. for the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions. ""the bacon's under the dog, where it should be,"" he noted.  the french fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through. we liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box.  dog: $2.90, fries: $2.25   â¢ â¢ â¢    rawley's drive-in 1886 post rd., fairfield, 259-9023  rawleys' dã©cor makes skanky frank's look positively posh. the wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin. two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together.  ""so. would you ever consider carrying a veggie dog, you think?""  ""no way!"" the one working the grill yelled. ""people freak out if we change anything here. we had to repair those walls,"" he gestured to two white walls behind him, ""to meet health codes, and people flipped out. a veggie dog? they'd kill us!""  they got every single thing about our order wrong--handed us someone else's food, gave art the wrong drink, rang the order up incorrectly, made it ""for here"" instead of ""to go."" the more flustered they got, the more they messed up. i didn't mind a bit. it somehow went with the summer camp vibe, and i thought it was probably a fluke. they were extremely apologetic. ""it was so busy a minute ago, we were slammed,"" the one at the cash register explained.  the word ""poop"" was engraved in huge letters right below the counter.  the cook pulled art's dog from the fry basket, split it and threw it on the grill. ""it's deep-fried and grilled?"" i asked, because i couldn't believe it. it was like a heart attack on a bun.  after a couple investigative bites, art reported that he actually preferred swanky frank's single dose of grease, though the rawley's dog also passed the crackly texture test, the bun was fresh and well-toasted and there was a generous amount of bacon draped over the dog.  i was still trying to interpret ""snappy."" ""is it that feeling of breaking the seal with your teeth?"" i asked.  ""exactly,"" he said.  ""i like that,"" i said.  ""that's the thing. it's so hard to judge hot dogs, because they're such a historical food in a person's life."" he gestured philosophically with his dog. ""people are fanatical about these. this is the perfect hot dog if it's what you grew up with.""  no one could get nostalgic about the fries, however, which were of the frozen, crinkle-cut variety, mealy and barely browned.  dog: $2.40, fries: $1.90   â¢ â¢ â¢    super duper weenie 306 black rock turnpike,fairfield, 334-dogs  i admit i was biased in favor of super duper weenie to begin with for its name. and if i had to eat off any of the linoleum-checked floors, this would be the one. by now i was resigned that there were no take-out veggie dogs in my near future... when i spotted its cousin on the menu.  ""how long have you carried veggie burgers for?"" i asked the cashier, who turned out to be one of the owners, lorin.  ""since we opened,"" he said.  ""but you don't have a veggie dog?""  ""veggie dog? i can't say we've ever considered it."" he appeared to actually be contemplating the concept.  ""would you consider it?""  ""i don't think they'd sell.""  ""do the veggie burgers sell?""  ""yeah.""  ""so why wouldn't a veggie dog?""  ""we're a greasy hot dog place.""  ""you could just try it out.""  ""we have tuna...""  ""please?""  ""i'll think about it. we've honestly never thought of it before.""  art surveyed his super duper dog. plentiful onions, two fat strips of bacon. but i could tell his assessment by the face he made when biting down. snappy. he liked the flavor of the meat, if not the texture, but swanky frank's was his personal overall favorite dog of the day, no question.  we agreed the fries were stellar--the best of the bunch by far. lots of skin, whittled-thin shapes, perfectly crisp with downy insides. lorin gave the batch a generous shake of pepper as well as salt. pepper on french fries! kind of nouveau cuisine for a former hot dog truck, don't you think? i just know an animal-free frank is next...  dog: $2.70 fries: $2.25  copyright â© 2004, fairfield county weekly"

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"07,June,2004","current phase: full moon in gemini  begins thursday 2:11 pm est / ends: monday 7:19 am est  the full moon is the time when the moon reflects the greatest amount of the sun's light. the earth is astronomically poised between the sun and the moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly, something the gemini energy is adept at spotting. the opposing but equally-pulling gravitational pull of the sun and the moon also reveals a tension within ourselves. the polarity of gemini is sagittarius.the polarity of a sign, is the sign that is opposite it in the zodiac. since we are in the sagittarius lunar cycle, that tension may be more pronounced.  by providing enough distance and light to give us an objective view of ourselves and how we relate to others, the full moon works to integrate and harmonize the contradictions in ourselves and others. this opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the full moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. there's literally an electrical energy build-up before a full moon and a release just after the peak. at the full moon, the seeds sown at the last new moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we've sown. working out the energy through the physical body can be grounding and centering.    about gemini (ruler mercury):   the astrological symbol of gemini is the twins. like their sign, the twins, they often have a dual nature and are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem, but they may also be fickle and restless.  within the zodiac, gemini is opposite sagittarius, the sign of philosophy. while sagittarius tends to have one major interest that is studied deeply, gemini people tend to have many different interests they study in less detail.  the element of gemini is air. air is vital to human survival. without air, we would perish. air is the power of movement; of freshening and of intellignce. its the invisible and yet quite real mixture of gases that we breathe in every day. the three air signs are gemini, libra, and aquarius. in astrology, air stands for intellect, reason and communication. the quality of gemini is mutable. the four mutable signs gemini, virgo, sagittarius, and pisces. in astrology, the mutable quality signifies versatility, adaptability, openness to change, and flexibility.   gemini - full moon meditation   from  urllink the labours of hercules    «i recognize my other self and while this fades i grow and glow.» (may 21 - june 20)  this full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of hercules from the greek myth. the twelve tasks of hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the heart of god. as mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal. so we travel ""on the path until we become that path"", from aries to taurus and gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to pisces. in gemini active work sets the standard tone. first comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in aries and overcome desire in taurus - the light of god everywhere.  in the third sign of the astrological year, gemini, the twins, hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the hesperides. unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed. perseverance holds the key.  the task appears to be easy and hercules hurries into it. but the garden of the hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins. throughout the land hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success. he is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way. from north he turns to south and wrestles with antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness. antaeus overcomes him at every point until hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground. to the west hercules now turns with new courage. he meets busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone. hercules loves and adores busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year. finally hercules turns inwards and realises that ""truth lies within yourself"". so he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before. a pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of hercules, the one of prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him. hercules breaks the binding chain, frees prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds. with much loss of time hercules turns to the high mountains of the east, meeting atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back. hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain. he forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay. so he shoulders the burden of his brother unto his own back. but lo! the load rolls off and he stands free and likewise atlas. from the loving hands of atlas he gets the long awaited golden apples. three sisters - aegle, erythea and hesperis - await him with more apples declaring ""the way to us is always marked by service. deed of love are signposts on the way"". the story ends with hercules returning the apples to the three sisters ""for those who follow"".  the sign of gemini consists of two pillars connected with a half-moon shaped arch: one pillar is open at the bottom, the other at the top. they symbolise the lower nature (body, feeling, mind) and the higher self (atma-buddhi-manas). the pairs of opposites reveal themselves especially forceful in this sign - the higher self striving upwards, the form aspect drawing downwards. five tests hercules has to pass before the fruits of wisdom become his own: sincerity, alertness, persistence, the unfolding of power for the search, and - finally - the selfless loving service for others.  in gemini, we learn to recognize the presence of the higher self. in the beginning one is aware of voice but does not hear, one sees or has a premonition of some danger but is blind until all assumptions and beliefs are transformed into knowledge and experience. prometheus stands for the escape from the bondage of the mind, atlas symbolizes the freedom and readiness to carry ""the weight of the world"". both, prometheus and atlas are witnesses on the way to our awareness of the higher self. loving compassion born of right thinking will lead us towards the goal. the keynote signifies that the lower nature (body, feelings and mind) - symbolized in the lower pillar of the sign - has to fade and become submerged to the higher self which will then grow and glow.   sources:   urllink artcharts    urllink http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/tidepool/4036/gemini.html    urllink the labours of hercules"

to a high-vibration start. it also gives us a chance to move into the years end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong saturn influences.  according to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of lifes most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated. the current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to  tap into transpersonal forces .  according to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit.  from these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest. on special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by wikkans and central americans of native descent). at its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (mother earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear.  the race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the samhain new moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to  multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding:  strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing years goals . stay tuned to our meditation for the full moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our years work, as we will also share a magical full moon offering to heal mother earth.  before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, lets reflect on what this particular samhain new moon has to do with tolerance. in the first place, wikkans especially focus on that virtue at this time, as they pay homage their predecessors who were burned at the stake by european churches. furthermore, the intense saturn stationary-retrograde which takes place right with this new moon gives us a chance to effectively remake how we exercise our moral, and, as it is in cancer, emotional, judgment nature. metaphysically speaking, we have a chance to soften the punishing patriarch within,  informing our judgment nature with love , staying the mental hand that would condemn without previous, compassionate reflection.  tolerance is a personal and global necessity. as remotely savage as the witch-burnings may seem, the danger of such extreme, thoughtless outbursts will lurk ever beneath the surface of our daily normalcy until we include careful, open-minded consideration, both compassionate and rational, in our a way of thought and life. politically, such an approach can protect us from mass manipulation into rash, fundamentalist support of scapegoating, such as evidenced in nazi germany, the mccarthy witch-hunts, modern day treatment of muslims, and the recent special elections in california.  the following principle is inscribed on the emerald tablet, ""as above, so below."" if you are still reading this by now, chances are youre among those who consider ourselves relatively tolerant. in such cases, prayer is a strong ally to pass from philosophic lenience to the ability to release emotional condemnation of those whose value systems diverge, even widely, from our own. moral tolerance does not necessarily imply putting up with unacceptable conditions, but rather  staying free from the judgment trap , of sentencing those that differ from our most cherished tenets. prayer for this intent can release us to the power of higher love, which in turn will touch our personal realms, eventually influencing the larger communities of city, state, country and globe, lifting all levels up into a magical sphere of protection for the planet, for spirit, for ourselves and for every visible and invisible being. this dimension of inner abundance will survive even when our outer forms, like the harvests last fruits, are released unto mother earth.  call on the power of endings to usher in a happy close to your passing year!  1) make a list of those goals for work and other applied efforts you can remember having at the beginning of 2003.  2) on another page, briefly describe those activities, situations, behaviors, beliefs or attachments which you feel have kept you from consolidating those goals.  3) call on the angel of endings, and ask her to assist you in accepting the demise of whatever situations would delay the consolidation of your divine plan for 2003. then declare aloud, 13 times, as you visualize their meaning:  i call on the power of endings which is now renewing the earth, to eliminate all that would delay the consolidation of my highest work. just as leaves now fall away and are dissolved into the earth, those situatons, activities, beliefs and behaviors that need to, now drop from the panorama of my life so that my highest endeavors may consolidate and prosper, quickly and in peace."

""the devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things,"" says mr wang.   many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them.   when sir paul mccartney did a webcast of a performance at the cavern in liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show.   under the scheme proposed by the us researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it.   mr wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source. the bees ""die"" when users stop requesting clips.   belgian scientist marco dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet. but he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people.   the bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do.   this rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the lord of the rings movie currently being filmed in new zealand.   the troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed.   battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action."

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"28,January,2002","urllink are we not geeks?     tolkien and his keen readers are often criticised for being stuck in eternal adolescence, and labelled as geeks. i'd like to take a closer look at these labels.   consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they're want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals. many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one's 'inner child.' the inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world. well and good; evidently the ""inner child"" is regarded as good and precious. but what can we say about the inner adolescent? why aren't we nurturing the inner adolescent?   i think you can hardly say the phrase 'teenager' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one's own years of irritable awkwardness. we haven't got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should. the author philip pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers.   at that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: what is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose? later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared.   i'd agree with that. i'd go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world's tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly. as one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest. i think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils.   i'd like to throw in one of the ultimate romantic poems i've ever come across. it's by an argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture:   for afterwards  i would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight.  and in the final instants i would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall.  to die when life is sadly hauling back  its golden nets from out the tide's deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that's lost from sight.  to die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: i am yours although we know so well it will betray us.  manuel gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (translation: gordon challis)  yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose. it is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life. it offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world. it may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness. but would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness? i could not bear the loss.   for this is the inner teenager that tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to. they are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds.   nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans. sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too. because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not.   the whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too. other people are involved in writing more about this, but i'll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts. firstly, what is a geek? articles like julian dibbell's 'lord of the geeks' article on village voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they're some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world. they're losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media. (and i might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.)   my own definition of geeks is this: a geek cares about a subject or system so much that they're willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not. the link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they're absorbed in play. it's only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there's some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising. instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they'd rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin. sometimes they're fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they've found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they'll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks.   the larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame. in their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else. geeks resist that because, well, it'd mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity.   there's always been geeks. mozart? what a nerd! he had to be a geek. who illuminated medieval manuscripts? who preserved literacy during the difficult, violent centuries of the dark ages? geek monks who remembered what civilisation was! who were pythagoras and socrates and archimedes? total geeks every one of them, with their heads in the clouds.   and so i ask, if anything worth doing is to be done: are we not geeks?   written by tehanu@theonering.net"

and more than a million children become children of divorced parents.   divorce is a crisis of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes. according to the dictionary, a ""crisis"" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur. that is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so. in fact, the chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning danger and opportunity. the process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.   the dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--loss. whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce. recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.   it is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma. reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror. in these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.   a later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning. feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression. again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate. it is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.   the dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense. for children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it. this loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster. furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings. thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss. to help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect. they need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs. they need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage. they need structure and routine and consistency. finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling. and they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.   as stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity. once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce. the crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings. it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment. at this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience. through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life. for many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.   for most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous. there are many books available to assist you in these challenges. two useful ones are divorcing by kranzler and belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and how to survive the loss of a love by colgrove, bloomfiled and mcwilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general). also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce. consult with the counseling center in shoemaker hall (314-7651) or the mental health clinic in the health center (314-8106). they offer support and help.     the author, kathy zamostny, is a staff psychologist at the university counseling center.   this article was originally presented in the commuter connection, a production of the office of commuter affairs."

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"08,July,2002","urllink   the four emotional stages of divorce work by phil rich, ed.d., msw. the end of marriage   the hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence. accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting.   divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners. regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss.   divorce is composed of both ""technical"" and ""emotional"" aspects. the technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process. but the ""other"" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath. this is ""divorce work"" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce.    the emotional stages of divorce  although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they're not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time. at this difficult time, it can help to understand what's typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they're likely to experience, and in what order. these are the ""emotional"" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through.   the necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include:  facing the reality of the divorce  working through painful feelings  experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage  coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss  adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life    stage 1:  ""shock and disbelief"" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in. it involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through.  facing reality  self esteem and inadequacy  telling the world  support and help    stage 2:  ""initial adjustment"" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives. the primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include:  functioning and responsibility  practical reality  legal matters  managing emotions    stage 3:  ""active re-organization"" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single. major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include:  managing life style and practical affairs  re-defining relationships  reconstructing personal values and beliefs  concluding legal procedures    stage 4:  ""life re-formation"" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the ""other"" side of their divorce. during this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives.  constructing relationships  new interests  personal responsibility  accepting your new life    summary and conclusion  the first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly. it's the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over. the second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce. the final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life. this stage really has no formal ""end,"" and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional.   of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap. and things aren't as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next. but helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them.   references:  burns b., & whiteman, t.

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"31,August,2002","urllink   question: you've discussed briefly some of the physiological and emotional differences between the sexes. could you list other physical characteristics unique to males and females?   dr. dobson responds:  men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren't even conscious of. here are just a few of those differences:   1. a woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern. normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the u.s. females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus. more than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.159   2. men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.160   3. men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.161   4. the sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk. the first finger of a woman's hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true. boys' teeth last longer than do those of girls.162   5. women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.163   6. women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly. female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied. the glands work differently in the two sexes. for example, a woman's thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty. women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.164   7. women's blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells). since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint. her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter. when the working day in british factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.165   8. men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.166   9. women's hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute). their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.167   10. female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.168   11. women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.169   12. men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern. the implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle. for example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways. the young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top. women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170   who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness?"

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"01,November,2002","urllink robert e. wilkinson 's the quantum brahman   in their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world's leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe. scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact. the first of these categories is the gravitational force. it is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force. the gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the sun, moon and planets. the second category is the electromagnetic force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles. while it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another. the third category called the weak nuclear force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos. in 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism. it is now called the electro-weak force. the fourth category, called the strong nuclear force, binds particles together into combinations. matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks. the strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.   while these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe. this problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification. their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the luminiferous ether. it was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances. to the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions. but, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field. leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation. since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the quantum vacuum. however, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the quantum vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe. scientists now agree that it was the quantum vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe. and they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum. a number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a grand unified field formula.   the discovery of the quantum vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon. physicists cautiously agree that the quantum vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter. there is even a growing consensus among scientists that vacuum physics lie at the core of everything. but, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the quantum vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go. they have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable. the laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.   in order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the quantum vacuum and measure the density of the transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of time. for time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter. for centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that time was a derivative of space even to the point of calling it 'space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; time is what gives birth to space.   in his commentaries on the brihadaranyaka upanishad, one of india's oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, sri aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle:   "" ... the [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed. (time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.) from the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal. time in its period is the self of the horse sacrificial, so not matter but time, is the body of this force of the material universe... space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of time which the sage attributes to his horse of the worlds, by movement in space its periods are shaped and determined. hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of space, but the magnitudes of time... for time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in space possible.""   sri aurobindo, the upanishads; 'the great aranyaka', sri aurobindo ashram press, 1971  in the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest. they may exist in being but not in time. they are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of time. for it is saturn/chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the supreme godhead into material form.   in its native state, the absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; one without a second. in order for the incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible. it does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms. it manifests first as cosmic and planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain. through this alchemical process, the absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated unity into form and multiplicity. this act of contraction, is the basis upon which the greek myths portray saturn/chronos as having dismembered his father.   in order to break the code of the transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy. it must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach. scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality. fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order.   one of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, david bohm in his book, wholeness and the implicate order. using the language of mathematics, bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the explicate order.   ""the explicate order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the implicate order. it is the precursor of the explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object. the implicate order implies within it all physical universes. however, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential. it is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order. bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence. the creative process springs from this realm. energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order.""   will keepin, david bohm, noetic science journal  when bohm's resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality.   the zero point order which bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of indian metaphysics known as the brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as absolute being. realization of the brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of time and consciousness which we experience as timelessness, or undifferentiated time. in this state time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness. hence it cannot produce any form or any division of consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in space.   in the language of physics the brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as emptiness or a void. it appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases. the amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line. in this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said. bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power. his calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this zero point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe.   bohm's work with zero point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the absolute or brahman becomes manifest in time and space. and while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like sri aurobindo, bohm's discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits emptiness or a void as the highest spiritual realization.   ""nothing can arise from nothing. asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, ""here there is nothing."" out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero. but what in truth is this zero? it is an incalculable infinite... our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness. in truth there is nothing but light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision's limited range.""  sri aurobindo, the web of yoga, centenary edition, vol. 17, p. 48  bohm's breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish fullness rather than a void as the ground state of the universe. the implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of spirit and matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter.   while these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of vedic india. long ago the rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the etheric plenum, or fullness from which all things emerge. according to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that etheric plenum. the atharva veda describes that point or seed as an 'embryo [hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.' this embryo or seed lies at the intersection of time and space, spirit and matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution. in the language of scientific cosmology, this point or seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being. in metaphysical terms it is the luminiferous ether, the om or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin. all material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time. once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the seer to follow the evolving in our time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction.   knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the vedic rishis because it allowed them to follow the unfolding of that seed and 'see' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality. they were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line. this knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the rig veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over. the seer became displaced by the nirvani as emphasis shifted from gnosis to a philosophy of illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a transcendent consciousness. as a result of this development, the bridge between the transcendent and the physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant. it was understood that the brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the all was once again a great mystery.   ""when the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence. more importantly, that essence itself became deformed. the experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth. this was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on earth. above all, creation became divested of true sacredness.""   patrizia norelli-bachelet, the vishaal newsletter, october, 1988  today, some two thousand years later, science and spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that truth or salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit. the influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven science and spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence. the key to that paradigm is a new understanding of time and its primary role bridging the transcendent and the physical world.   ""it cannot be denied that time is a major feature of our material universe. in consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go 'beyond time', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate time. conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of time. furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation.""   patrizia norelli-bachelet, the new way, vol. 3, 1983  in the early 1970's patrizia norelli-bachelet, the world's leading authority on vedic cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries. she had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient india evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture. the rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends. their knowledge of time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as truth-consciousness or swar of the veda. the rishis understood that the cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form. they also knew that the difference between man/woman and the cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the macrocosm and microcosm had a correspondent equivalence. through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world. since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life. if man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of cosmic time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience. since the same zero womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of truth-consciousness or gnosis.   this was the essence of the rig vedic yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970's by patrizia norelli-bachelet. from the principles of these ancient teachings, ms. norelli-bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, the gnostic circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos.   ""the gnostic circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system. the circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of earth life. the joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the spirit. in fact we can say that the gnostic circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind.""   patrizia norelli-bachelet ,the gnostic circle, p. 159, 1975  ms. norelli-bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of time and measure. her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of time as the integrative mechanism by which a divine purpose is expressed in the world. her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material reality which include the being as well as the dynamics of the becoming of that same being. ""time"", says norelli-bachelet, ""is the vehicle, the medium for the absolute or supreme consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the spiritual and physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the supreme within the physical manifestation .""   in ms. norelli-bachelet's cosmology, the zero womb or what science is now calling the quantum vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the sun or primary axis of our own universe. the nine planets which orbit about the sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that zero/womb/axis. the planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called cabalistic reduction. since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of number and relate the movement of the spheres to the calendar which measures time periods on earth. through this system of cosmic harmonies, the gnostic circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between time and space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.   by unveiling the quantum brahman or body of the absolute, ms. norelli-bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the zero womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form. she has rebuilt the bridge between spirit and matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order. through the use of her gnostic circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the explicate universe. ms. norelli-bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality.   2/12/96   robert e. wilkinson    p. o. box 396  accord, new york 12404"

the power to change your world rests within yourself  within your mind!    thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities. this physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise. when you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create. you make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want. remember! you have a right to create your own world.    that right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers  divine powers, we might add  who cherish that right themselves. they would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you. except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation.    to reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess. doing both will take time. however, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation.    to begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you cant control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control. along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness. your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality.    learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process. good reality-control comes from within, not without. an uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal. this untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires. all these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation. except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast. when a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beasts world. this haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid. your consciousnesss driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants.    now, to help make our point, lets take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness.      does you mind wander regularly  jumping from topic to topic? in other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items? anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering. mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast.   do you continually look on the negative side of things? a negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness  not you! emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating. however, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over. emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within.   do you often feel mentally drained? continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation. with inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life. if you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you. poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you.   do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation? not knowing how a device operates  especially an inner device  can greatly hinder your ability to use it. a computer is no good if you havent a clue how to operate it! thought-creation is the same. your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world. otherwise, youll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone. while the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days. so, if you dont understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level.    im sure many of you answered yes to some of these questions. answering yes does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned. being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources. because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity. you must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others.    with a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life. for one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you. you will create the world you want and need. there will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute. if you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it. your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory. you will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time. plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations. when an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you. you will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny.    you create your world! no other statement is more true. now it is your job to learn how. take the first step toward controlling your reality, and we can help you with the second. recognize, at least a little, that you can and do have the power to create your world. youve been doing it for years, since you were born and before. then, lets take that second step together and learn how to properly use those inner tools  inner tools that will enable you to control the greatest gift in your possession, your own consciousness.      worksheet notes:   on the next page is your first worksheet. it is a questionnaire designed to show you your present level of reality creating ability. please take the time to fill in the questionnaire because the real power in this questionnaire will reveal itself when you come back to it, after youve finished the hermes reality creator i course and retake the test. your new score will show you how much you have progressed and how much farther you need to work the reality creating game. each question is designed to alert you to a different area of reality creating skill.   question one shows you how positively you think about your reality.  question two shows you how well you can control your lower self, your more base instincts, the animal part of you, if you will.  question three shows you how well you can keep your mind focused in the present moment.  question four shows you how well you can regulate your inner power (energy).  question five shows you how easily you can be coerced by others.   after you take the test, then move on to the next chapter, but keep in mind the areas that you need to work on. as we get to that part of the book, you may want to pay extra attention to that section."

""true compassion,"" king declared, ""is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.""  by 1967, king had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the vietnam war, and a staunch critic of overall u.s. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic. in his ""beyond vietnam"" speech delivered at new york's riverside church on april 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- king called the united states ""the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.""  >from vietnam to south africa to latin america, king said, the u.s. was ""on the wrong side of a world revolution."" king questioned ""our alliance with the landed gentry of latin america,"" and asked why the u.s. was suppressing revolutions ""of the shirtless and barefoot people"" in the third world, instead of supporting them.  in foreign policy, king also offered an economic critique, complaining about ""capitalists of the west investing huge sums of money in asia, africa and south america, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries.""  you haven't heard the ""beyond vietnam"" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it. time magazine called it ""demagogic slander that sounded like a script for radio hanoi."" the washington post patronized that ""king has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.""  in his last months, king was organizing the most militant project of his life: the poor people's campaign. he crisscrossed the country to assemble ""a multiracial army of the poor"" that would descend on washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the capitol, if need be-- until congress enacted a poor people's bill of rights. reader's digest warned of an ""insurrection.""  king's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild america's cities. he saw a crying need to confront a congress that had demonstrated its ""hostility to the poor""-- appropriating ""military funds with alacrity and generosity,"" but providing ""poverty funds with miserliness.""  how familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after king's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet.  as 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the white house and congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty. and so do most mass media. perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of martin luther king's life.  ------------------ media beat is norman solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics. until 1996, the column was co-written by fair's founder, jeff cohen (cohen no longer works at fair). for more media beat columns, visit:  urllink http://www.fair.org/media-beat/index.html   ------------------ you can listen to some of martin luther king jr.'s anti-war speeches, including the riverside church speech, at the national radio project's website:   urllink http://www.radioproject.org/temp/king.html         ---------- please support fair by subscribing to our bimonthly magazine, extra! for more information, go to:  urllink http://www.fair.org/extra/subscribe.html . or call 1-800-847-3993.  fair shirts: get your ""don't trust the corporate media"" shirt today at fair's online store: http://www.merchantamerica.com/fair/  fair produces counterspin, a weekly radio show heard on over 130 stations in the u.s. and canada. to find the counterspin station nearest you, visit  http://www.fair.org/counterspin/stations.html .  fair's internship program: fair accepts internship applications for its new york office on a rolling basis. for more information, see:  http://www.fair.org/internships.html  feel free to respond to fair ( fair@fair.org ). we can't reply to everything, but we will look at each message. we especially appreciate documented examples of media bias or censorship. and please send copies of your email correspondence with media outlets, including any responses, to fair@fair.org .  you can subscribe to fair-l at our web site: http://www.fair.org . our subscriber list is kept confidential.                                   fair                              (212) 633-6700                           http://www.fair.org/                           e-mail: fair@fair.org"

""it made the most sense to engage them in the near term as the company to get the mission done because they were familiar with the details of the fires themselves and what would be needed,"" he said.   the value of the contract would depend on the scale of the work.   the chief of britain's armed forces, admiral sir michael boyce, said friday that iraqi forces had set fire to seven oil wells in the south of the country.   kbr would claim the cost of its services plus two to five percent depending on how it executed the job, pawlik said.   ""kbr was selected for this award based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice,"" the company said in a statement.   kbr said it had teams of well control and engineering contractors preparing the initial phase.   the company was given a free hand to choose subcontractors for the work, the corps spokesman said.   kbr chose houston-based boots and coots international, with which it has a services and equipment partnership, and wild well control inc. as firefighting subcontractors.   president george w. bush (news - web sites)'s spokesman, ari fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details.   asked about the contracting process, fleischer told a news conference: ""the question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires. refer your question to the agencies involved. i am not familiar with the details of this contract.""   in a statement late monday, the defense department said the army corps of engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities.   kellogg, brown and root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, pentagon said. the contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said.   ""we have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment,"" boots and coots president brian krause said in a statement.   ""we will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure,"" he said.   boots and coots was brought into kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the gulf war (news - web sites), it said.   cheney was chief executive of the kbr parent company halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000."

""war is not about technology,"" he said. ""behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk,"" lostremote reported.  and, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots. and, perhaps, no plane shot down at all.  it's difficult to lie when the cameras are on.  and the cameras are always on, these days.  even at 50 miles-per-hour.  spectacular footage from nbc reporter david bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain. the equipment is from maritime telecommunications network (mtn), of miramar, florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed.  but even though it is all digital, it's not all cameras.  the websites of iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic. the websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds. by sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the uruklink sites, and while the iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to ""live coverage"" was broken.  the iraqi news agency site, part of the uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed. it contains an outdated link to the former website of the iraq satellite channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime.  according to brian mcwilliams of pc-radio.com, ""web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching uruklink.net, the iraq government's main website, after the us launched its initial attack wednesday night. but those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing.  ""in fact, traffic to uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site. the homepage of uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today. that would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in december. the previous traffic record occurred on feb. 9, when the site's address was published in the drudge report.""  mcwilliams told politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist declan mccullagh, that the main iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country's two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.  we suggest sending email to saddam.   - www.nbr.co.nz"

""it is still too early to speak about the freedom of the press,"" said ali abdel-amir, senior editor of nidaa al-mustaqbal, a newspaper of the iraqi national accord, a longtime umbrella organization for iraqi opposition groups.   ""there is anarchy now,"" abdel-amir said. ""many of these people working in the press are not professional or objective.""   the u.s.-led military coalition that occupied the country has two radio networks of its own, one run by former employees of station previously owned by saddam's elder son, odai. information radio features news announcements, arabic music and even western music like the occasional rendition of ""the power of love"" by huey lewis and the news.   another station, radio of the iraqi republic, run by former information ministry officials, urges listeners to forget the past and work together for a better future.   in baghdad, viewers can tune into the coalition information channel or watch channels from neighboring iran, primarily the arabic-language al-aalam.   ali al-fatlawi, a reporter who worked previously for government newspapers, says working for assaah is much better.   ""there is more freedom and more openness,"" he said. ""the red lines have been lifted, and we can express ourselves freely and without threats."""

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"12,May,2003","why are women leaving corporate america and where are they going? by denise gürer   urllink http://www.cobolreport.com/columnists/denise/07292002.asp   in todays fast paced world, people are expected to change jobs many times and even change careers several times in their lifetime.  even so, women are leaving corporate america at twice the rate of men.  why are they leaving and where are they going?  many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender.  many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling.  many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate america is not willing to give.  many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers.  for all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses.  a majority of these organizations are wildly successful.  women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the u.s. overall economic health and competitiveness.    why are women leaving? even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snails pace.  the glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back.  thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions.  in fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (moore and buttner 1997).  in addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company.  in a different study by catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (catalyst 1998).  this suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments.  this further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their companys direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility.  in many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.  this cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity.    another factor is many women feel they are undervalued.  in fact, pay equity is still a problem.  in the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (chao 2001).  more specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (usdol 2001).  another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children.  however there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children.  this discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers.  to counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both.  many view this support as something the company should provide.  when the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors.  how can corporations reverse this trend? in todays knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections.  the loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements.  all of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (donahue 1998).    a corporations first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular.  this could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews.  statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem.  these could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria.  gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion.  in particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company.    it is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them.  based on this research, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented.  it is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort.  managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity.    some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting.   women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (van velsor and hughes 1990).  thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization.  another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued.  this is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male).  other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation.    essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business?  if business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women.  given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women.  characteristics and culture of women owned businesses starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers.  however, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility.  they are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles.    for high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology.  just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (nfwbo 2001b).  this follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the u.s.  the most recent statistics from the department of education show women graduates at 58.3% of b.s. graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (nces 2001).   no matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table.  nfwbo found that 53% of women business owners emphasize right-brain thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (nfwbo 1994).  the same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events.    the attributes of a companys leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace.  women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in family terms and work within a network of business relationships.  men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (nfwbo 1994; gürer 2001).  the nfwbo study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny.  men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals.  thus, womens leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a web of inclusion (see gürer 2001; helgesen 1995), while mens leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach.   another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing.  only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do.  for large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (nfwbo 1994).  in addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses.    diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership.  not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce.  women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men).  men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (nfwbo 2000a).    the success of women-owned businesses from an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful.  in 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (nfwbo 1999).  of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue.  these businesses are also financially stable.  women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all u.s. firms (cwbr 1995).  businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy.  the growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (uscb 1997).  from 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%.  with respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (nfwbo 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector.    still some difficulties even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender.  one key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background.  these are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success.    women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.  only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.  in addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual angel investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (nfwbo 2000b).  women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (nfwbo 2001b).  this reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity.    given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.  there are currently programs that strive towards these goals  many of which can be linked to via the center for women's business researchs website at http://www.nfwbo.org  catalyst for change? the management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.  interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.  a recent survey of technology professionals by webgrrls, in western new york, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (drury 2001).  men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.  in addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.  it is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.  however, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.  the webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.  even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.  as the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.  the tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.  regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.  these businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the fortune 500 companies of the future.  references catalyst (1998) women entrepreneurs: why companies lose female talent and

the gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), i am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, i am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, i am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., i am not; even the mind which thinks, i am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, i am not.   2. if i am none of these, then who am i? after negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that awareness which alone remains - that i am.   3. what is the nature of awareness? the nature of awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss   4. when will the realization of the self be gained? when the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the self which is the seer.   5. will there not be realization of the self even while the world is there (taken as real)? there will not be.   6. why? the seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.   7. when will the world which is the object seen be removed? when the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.   8. what is the nature of the mind? what is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the self. it causes all thoughts to arise. apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. therefore, thought is the nature of mind. apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. in deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. in the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. when the mind comes out of the self, the world appears. therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the self does not appear; and when the self appears (shines) the world does not appear. when one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the self (as the residue). what is referred to as the self is the atman. the mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. it is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).   9. what is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind? that which rises as 'i' in this body is the mind. if one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'i' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. that is the place of the mind's origin. even if one thinks constantly 'i' 'i', one will be led to that place. of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'i' thought is the first. it is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. it is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.   10. how will the mind become quiescent? by the inquiry 'who am i?'. the thought 'who am i?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. then, there will arise self-realization.   11. what is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'who am i?' when other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'to whom do they arise?' it does not matter how many thoughts arise. as each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, ""to whom has this thought arisen?"". the answer that would emerge would be ""to me"". thereupon if one inquires ""who am i?"", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. with repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. when the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the heart is what is called ""inwardness"" (antar-mukha). letting the mind go out of the heart is known as ""externalisation"" (bahir-mukha). thus, when the mind stays in the heart, the 'i' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the self which ever exists will shine. whatever one does, one should do without the egoity ""i"". if one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of siva (god).   12. are there no other means for making the mind quiescent? other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. if through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. the source is the same for both mind and breath. thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. the thought ""i"" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. it is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent. but in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop. this is because of the will of god, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead. in the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled. breath is the gross form of mind. till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it. therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa). like the practice of breath-control. meditation on the forms of god, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.   through meditation on the forms of god and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed. the mind will always be wandering. just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone. when the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind self-inquiry will become easy. of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to self-inquiry.   13. the residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean. when will all of them get destroyed? as the meditation on the self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed.   14. is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure self? without yielding to the doubt ""is it possible, or not?"", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the self. even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep ""o! i am a sinner, how can i be saved?""; one should completely renounce the thought ""i am a sinner""; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the self; then, one would surely succeed. there are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one. it is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious. when the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil. the mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people. however bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them. both desire and hatred should be eschewed. all that one gives to others one gives to one's self. if this truth is understood who will not give to others? when one's self arises all arises; when one's self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent. to the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good. if the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere.   15. how long should inquiry be practised? as long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry ""who am i?"" is required. as thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry. if one resorts to contemplation of the self unintermittently, until the self is gained, that alone would do. as long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.   16. what is the nature of the self? what exists in truth is the self alone. the world, the individual soul, and god are appearances in it. like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time. the self is that where there is absolutely no ""i"" thought. that is called ""silence"". the self itself is the world; the self itself is ""i""; the self itself is god; all is siva, the self.   17. is not everything the work of god? without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest. just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of god that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas. god has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to him. that is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space.   18. of the devotees, who is the greatest? he who gives himself up to the self that is god is the most excellent devotee. giving one's self up to god means remaining constantly in the self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the self. whatever burdens are thrown on god, he bears them. since the supreme power of god makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not? we know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease?   19. what is non-attachment? as thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment. just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the self-pearl.   20. is it not possible for god and the guru to effect the release of a soul? god and the guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. in truth, god and the guru are not different. just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the guru's gracious look will be saved by the guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by god or guru and gain release. one can know oneself only with one's own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else's. does he who is rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is rama?   21. is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)? just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the self. the world should be considered like a dream.   22. is there no difference between waking and dream? waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference. just as waking happenings seem real while awake. so do those in a dream while dreaming. in dream the mind takes on another body. in both waking and dream states thoughts. names and forms occur simultaneously.   23. is it any use reading books for those who long for release? all the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading. in order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one's self is; how could this search be done in books? one should know one's self with one's own eye of wisdom. the self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. since the self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. there will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned.   24. what is happiness? happiness is the very nature of the self; happiness and the self are not different. there is no happiness in any object of the world. we imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. when the mind goes out, it experiences misery. in truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the self. similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure self-happiness. thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the self and returning to it. under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. a person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. a wise man stays permanently in the shade. similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave brahman. the mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to brahman to experience happiness. in fact, what is called the world is only thought. when the world disappears, i.e. when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.   25. what is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)? remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight. to remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the self. telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight.   26. what is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom? desirelessness is wisdom. the two are not different; they are the same. desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object. wisdom means the appearance of no object. in other words, not seeking what is other than the self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the self is wisdom.   27. what is the difference between inquiry and meditation? inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the self. meditation consists in thinking that one's self is brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss.   28. what is release? inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage, and realising one's true nature is release.   sri ramanarpanam astu"

""the other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people,"" he added.   lacking relevance?   the other reason why sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses.   it was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry.   there are some who opt for sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one's overall grades.   but most students learn the language to know about the past. some study sanskrit to improve their grades. there is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most sanskrit colleges are publicly funded.   critics of sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses.   however, sanskrit scholars like girish jani rubbish this approach.   ""why should we read shakespeare? why should we read sartre? are they connected really with the life in the first attempt? no.   ""we, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need sanskrit.""   scholars like mr jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement,   but the sad reality is that sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin."
15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"09,June,2003","urllink nasa researcher, rick briggs has written:   ""in ancient india the intention to discover truth was so consuming, that in the process, they discovered perhaps the most perfect tool for fulfilling such a search that the world has ever known -- the sanskrit language. there is at least one language, sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in artificial intelligence. this article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in ai has been reinventing a wheel millennia old.  the discovery is of monumental significance. it is mind-boggling to consider that we have available to us a language which has been spoken for 4-7000 years that appears to be in every respect a perfect language designed for enlightened communication. but the most stunning aspect of the discovery is this: nasa the most advanced research center in the world for cutting edge technology has discovered that sanskrit, the world's oldest spiritual language is the only unambiguous spoken language on the planet. considering sanskrit's status as a spiritual language, a further implication of this discovery is that the age old dichotomy between religion and science is an entirely unjustified one.  it is also relevant to note that in the last decade physicists have begun to comment on the striking similarities between their own discoveries and the discoveries made thousands of years ago in india which went on to form the basis of most eastern religions.  why has sanskrit endured? fundamentally it generates clarity and inspiration. and that clarity and inspiration is directly responsible for a brilliance of creative expression such as the world has rarely seen.   another hope for the return of sanskrit lies in computers. sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit. the precision play of sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that would inevitably transform the world. in fact the mere learning of sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will provide in the arena of future communication.""

(jacobs is partial to old dodges and toyotas. he also owns a banged-up toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks. he replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.)   the van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier. and then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years. one previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member. and back when the van was new it was an animal control truck.  ""i don't think they called it that back then,"" jacobs said. ""i think they called it the dog-catcher van. it was up in the san juan islands; i think that's why it has the rust.""  in the three or four years he has owned it, jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission. ""it was so much work getting it out, i figured i would do it all,"" he said.  ""i'm not going to tell you how much money i've put into it,"" he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van.  ""i found the van on the internet,"" jacobs said. ""this guy wanted $400 for it. the picture looked so good, but when i got there it looked like (bleep!)."" so jacobs bargained the price down.  ""i paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt,"" he said. ""they don't sell these anymore, so i had to have it rebuilt.""    jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade (""i don't know if i'll keep doing this kind of work,"" he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is. and while he acknowledges that the van isn't in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it.   ""there's no way i could ever sell it and get back what i've put into it,"" he said.  that rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but jacobs admits the van doesn't run as well as it could.  ""it would be nice to say that,"" he said. ""it doesn't run perfect, but it gets the job done."""

""no."" she smiled on, ""they are very nice. have you tried them before? you should try!"" i smiled weakly, ""okay one poori and one nan."" i tried poori before, but prefer nan. but she was so unknowingly pushy that i patronised her. she walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, ""was the poori nice?"" my friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod. she too prefers nan. the waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another ""happy"" customer.   i call this ""the poori effect."" it is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one's perceptions. the waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite. due to the way she carried herself, we ""naturally obliged"". we were later ""obliged"" to give her a positive response- out of ""courtesy"". the result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori. we might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion. we sometimes ""unwittingly"" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back. but is your smile true? on the other hand, is your smiling ""forcing"" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely? we see what we want to see. i know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs. the poori effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith. we are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback. this is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within. when we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too. either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue. can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way? even if the truth bites a little, does it matter? since it is ""sugar-coated"" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right?    asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind. some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like. ""no no, what does he know? pooris are the best!"" do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you? but what is the truth about preferences and opinions? preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory. because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject. everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less. pooris might taste much better if i let go of my aversion? nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers?   let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes. the more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others. when we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively. this is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment. only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to enlightenment! -  urllink shian@thedailyenlightenment.com"

""they're not comfortable at the moment with what we don't know."" a man died and several others were injured while riding disneyland's big thunder mountain railroad. the world council of churches denounced the invasion of iraq as ""immoral"" and ""ill advised"" and called for the withdrawal of american forces. a congressional study found that the occupation of iraq is unsustainable given the current size of the u.s. military, and the united states released a draft resolution calling on the united nations to create a multinational peacekeeping force for iraq that would remain under american military and political control. heavy fighting continued in afghanistan, and surface-to-air missiles were fired at a transport plane in baghdad. donald rumsfeld, who was nearby, said that such attacks are just a cost of doing business. rumsfeld claimed that there has been ""breathtaking"" progress in afghanistan since the war ended.

'if you think the social component is not important,' provine says, 'try tickling a stranger.'"

""their treatment does not reflect the nature of the american people,"" he said. ""that's not the way we do things in america.""   the urban institute released a study showing that in some u.s. counties 30 percent of the population is in prison, and an abortion provider in kansas city was accused of practicing fetal cannibalism. the united states used f-15e and f-16 warplanes, f-14 and f-18 fighter-bombers, ac-130 gunships, and ah-1w super cobra helicopters to bomb fallujah. british tornados were also used. some three dozen laser-guided 500-pound bombs were dropped, and at least one building was blown up by accident. a cobra helicopter fired a missile at a mosque and knocked over its minaret. u.s. forces, fearing a public relations disaster, pulled back from the city and left a new iraqi force in charge under the command of general jasim muhammad saleh, who served in the republican guard under saddam hussein. there was some confusion among american officials, however, as to whether the general was really in charge and whether he had actually served in the republican guard. iraq's governing council unveiled a new national flag that was immediately condemned for its strong resemblance to the flag of israel, which features the same shade of blue.

""then i thank you from my heart.""  as howard kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in god and man was strong also. he had been ready to give up and quit. many years later that same young woman became critically ill. the local doctors were baffled. they finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease.  dr. howard kelly was called in for the consultation. when he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.  immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. he recognized her at once. he went back to the consultation room determined to do his  best to save her life. from that day he gave special attention to her case. after a long struggle, the battle was won. dr. kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. he looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. she feared  to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for  it all. finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side  of the bill. she read these words.....""paid in full with one glass of milk""  (signed) dr. howard kelly tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: ""thank you, god, that your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands.""   there's a saying which goes something like this: bread cast on the waters comes back to you. the good deed you do today may benefit you or someone you love at the least expected time."

15365.female.34.indUnk.Cancer.xml,"18,July,2004","urllink warning: nicotine seriously improves health  robin mckie, science editor sunday july 18, 2004 the observer   nicotine could soon be rehabilitated as a treatment for schizophrenia, alzheimer's and parkinson's diseases, as well as hyperactivity disorders.  research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders.   some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of parkinson's symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics.   'a whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,' said dr dan mcgehee, a neurobiologist at the university of chicago. 'however, such benefits do not justify smoking. the lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide. on the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.'   nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure. this effect leads to a person's addiction.   more than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics. but smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent. 'the assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,' said mcgehee. 'they are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.'   this point is backed by dr tony george, of yale university. 'smoking is a marker for psychopathology,' he states in the current issue of the journal nature medicine.   similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of parkinson's, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells.   'either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in parkinson's, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy parkinson's cells,' said mcgehee. 'either way, the effect is noticeable.'"

(about half full). fill the blender with warm water. run the blender slowly at first then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well blended. ( 30 -40 seconds) check that no flakes of paper remain. if there are, blend longer.  3. the next step is to make a mold. the mold, in this case, is made simply by stretching fiberglass screen (plain old door and window screen) over a wooden frame and stapling it. it should be as tight as possible.  4. fill the basin about half way with water. add 3 blender loads of pulp. (the more pulp you add the thicker the finished paper will be) stir the mixture.  5. now is the time to add the liquid starch for sizing.(this is not necessary but if the paper is going to be used for writing on, you should add some, the starch helps to prevent inks from soaking into the paper fibers.) stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp.  place the mold into the pulp and then level it out while it is submerged. gently wiggle it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen looks even.  6. slowly lift the mold up until it is above the level of the water. wait until most of the water has drained from the new paper sheet. if the paper is very thick, remove some pulp from the tub. if it is too thin, add more pulp and stir the mixture again.  7. when the mold stops dripping, gently place one edge on the side of a fabric square (felt or flannel square). gently ease the mold down flat, with the paper directly on the fabric. use a sponge to press out as much water as possible. wring the excess water from the sponge back into the large plastic tub.  8. now comes the tricky part. hold the fabric square flat and slowly lift the edge of the mold. the wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. if it sticks to the mold, you may have pulled to fast or not pressed out enough water. it takes a little practice. you can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.  9. repeat the steps above, and stack the fabric squares on a cookie sheet. save one fabric square to place on the top of the stack to cover the last piece of paper. use another cookie sheet to press the remaining water out of the stack. (do this outside or in the bathtub, it can make a mess)  10. after you press the stack, gently separate the sheets. they can be dried by hanging on a clothesline or laying them out on sheets of newspaper. when they have dried peel them off the fabric and voila! you have paper!"

23166.female.25.indUnk.Virgo.xml,"18,July,2004","well, i decided to start this site after some bad customer support experiences with  urllink http://www.atkins.com  in their ""my atkins"" area.  their site is so slow and it's been impossible for me to upload my ""before"" photo to help me see my progress visually.  i figure it's probably better to have my own weight loss journal so that i can get exactly what i want out of it.      so, to tell about my situation...  i'm 25 years old, and i've been trying to lose weight since may 2003.  my highest weight ever was 400 pounds.  i've lost 57 pounds so far and it's been quite a journey.  i've had all sorts of eating habits..  for several months i was vegetarian because i got sick from fatty foods after having gallbladder surgery.  my gallbladder was taken out in july 2003 after i'd lost about 30 pounds rather quickly from low calorie dieting.  my doctor who did that surgery said that the pain might return because after physically looking at the stuff he took out of me he just didn't think that the stones were causing the kind of pain that i felt.  i don't really regret having the surgery since those stones had to pass at some point.  my dad had a stone pass once and it got stuck in a duct and he had to be hospitalized for a while, it was a really traumatic experience.  i'm glad i'm not going to have to go through that.     on july 12 2004 i started the atkins nutritional approach because of course that pain returned along with a lot of bowel symptoms.  i had read somewhere that eating low-carbohydrates can help ease the pain with some people who have irritable bowel syndrome.  boy were they right.  every time i thought back to all the times i got sick while eating, it was always after eating a bowl of mashed potatoes or a bunch of bread.  i talked this over with a gastroenterologist and he gave me the information that i needed to make a life-change to my eating habits that will make me not feel so sick anymore.  he agrees that i most likely have irritable bowel syndrome from discussing my history, dating all the way back to my childhood.  during the last month i've already had just about every other medical condition ruled out.  ibs can not be tested for.. it is a ""functional"" syndrome, meaning that there's no disease present, my body just works differently in a way that can be painful if i am not careful with the way that i eat.     so, i've been doing a sort of modified atkins plan for one week, and i already feel 95% better.  i've lost 2 inches off my measurements already (wow!) although the scale is playing games with my head.  that's probably due to all the water and that will come down with time as well.  i feel a little bit better every day.  two weeks ago, i didn't want to get out of bed because of the excruciating abdominal pain.  now i am able to live my life again.     right now i'm doing a modified atkins induction.  this means less than net 20 carbs a day, except i'm eating extra fiber foods than induction allows, such as spinach and broccoli, and i'm taking metamucil up to the recommended 25-30 grams of fiber a day.  first thing in the morning i have 36 ounces of water, split three ways, 2 doses of 17g miralax (polyethylene glycol.. ewww!), and the third 12 oz glass of water is my first metamucil of the day.  this morning routine is part of my bowel program given to me by my doctor last week.      if i dont follow the program the way that i do, i will get really, really sick just like i was before.  besides, the vitamins from my fiber veggies are really good for me.  speaking of vitamins, i take a one a day carb smart in the afternoon right before lunch time.   the motivation not to eat some french fries or a piece of bread, is the constant knowledge that eliminating them from my diet is the only reason that i am not in pain anymore.     i track all of my food/exercise using fitday pc which i bought at  urllink http://www.fitday.com  .  they have a free version that you can track your stuff through their website, but i like the pc version better because it has a lot more flexibility and options.      here are some links for articles about atkins and ibs, explaining why i am feeling a lot better:     urllink http://atkins.com/archive/2002/1/11-771731.html       urllink http://atkins.com/archive/2002/2/12-234348.html"

""what about mcdonalds"" with her sleepy voice still sleeping in bed... she wanted some breakfast or lunch .... so i left here and went and got us some grub when  i got back we ate together and i left for work.  she stayed home and then at 4 went to work.... blah thats done now.  i went to work then went to my boy kewons house and hooked up a computer.... saw his pitbulls ... after all of that i drove home and on the way sally called me and wanted me to come up there and see her... so i did.  i had the smoke house chicken dinner... after i ate that i went and smoked a cigerette with her in the backroom where she said to me, ""if i get caught i'm getting fired.."" heh see what she will do for a cigerette with me? hahah i'd like to think it was because i was there but i just think she needed a cigerette... :p  anywho now i'm home .... and i went out and bought 8 things of red bull and a 5th of vodka... and her and i are going to drink and play match.... for the first time in a minute her and i are going to have our alone night and i'm like so looking forward to it.... a night where her and i can make each other laugh and giggle... then by the end of the night with all of those intoxicants inside of us we will be going to bed... or at least trying.... so this defintly could be a good night from what i see so far... i'm totally excited.... okay here she is.... haha complaining about my pop she carried in getting on her shirt.... until next time.... peace"

""special"".  so what happens when you begin to see that vision of the unique quality in that special person changing beyond your control.  the person has several different qualities which make them so special, but this one quality almost defies the person to your heart.  possibly a quality that opens the door to your heart.  blah blah blah... i don't know where i'm going with this... or if i even wanna go on with this.... but none the less ....  it boils down to the fact, that no matter what i'm feeling or why i'm feeling it.... even if it makes sense to me... i can't react to it based on selfish reasons.....  but sometimes.... i just want to feel like... i'm worth a piece of sacrafice... because ... to me.... my special person is worth the ultimate sacrafice.. and if i would lay that down with out ever questioning a thing or think of being selfish... for something so little, why can't i feel that way?  its selfish in its self... and blah .... blah .... blah.  i'm going now..."

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?  well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.  in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.  in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn't.  now i'm having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.  i'm having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.  now i'm living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.  okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault.    then on top of that i'm having to deal with this new...""rule"".  you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month ""off of me"" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).  in a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be ""her choice"" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.  so i mean her decision can't shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?  well i'm still not feeling ""settled"" with all of it.  something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say ""okay we don't mind this now, you took a month off of him"" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don't know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i'm even more at loss... really... blah i just don't know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we'll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i'm counting...   keep ya updated.  latah."

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","so i went to see 'fahrenheit 911'. it's very impressive, and i certainly recommend that everyone go see it. some of it(oregon state police, etc)seems a bit unnecessary, but the vital and necessary stuff is profoundly vital and necessary. the part of the film that details the involvement between the bush family and the bin laden's and the saudi's is so disturbing that it makes my head ache. some very well documented and supported facts: 1-when george bush started his first oil company one of his biggest investors was the bin-laden family(yes, osama bin laden's family). 2-the bush family has received over $1.4 billion dollars from the saudi's and from the bin-laden family. 3-the saudi ambassador to the u.s is an 'unofficial' member of the bush family, and was invited to dinner at the white house on september 13th, 2001. 4-on september 13th over 50 members of the bin-laden family and citizens of saudi arabia were allowed to leave the united states without being questioned by the fbi, even though air traffic was shut down in the united states. 5-on september 11th, 2001 george bush senior and other members of the carlyle group(including members of the bin laden family and citizens of saudi arabia)watched on television as the twin towers were attacked by hijacked planes. 6-almost all references to saudi involvement in 9-11 have been blacked out by the bush administration. go see this movie, and if you doubt what i say then do a little research and you'll quickly realize that we have suffered through an administration(bush's)that is profoundly corrupt in ways that we never could have even imagined. bush, cheney, halliburton, enron, the bin-laden's, the house of saud, and the hundreds of billions of dollars made from oil(iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)are why we went to war. there were no wmd's in iraq, there were no nascent nuclear programs in iraq, there was no al qaeda presence in iraq. the sad and tragic truth is that we went to war in iraq for oil profits. that's it, and now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt. and it's utterly disgusting.   urllink click here for showtimes and listings.   -goodnight"

""hey come party""... so of course last night i partied.  *sigh*  june 5th 2005 still going strong...   wed night was crazy.  i went to jd's in pontiac which is this little dope piano bar... it was a pretty laid back atmosphere until i had 13 beers in my system and they were about to close - and the guys on the piano started playing loose yourself by eminem... yea things got a little crazy.  *sigh* so after the bar let out.. i ventured to find my car - which was no where to be found... we did find it the next day though after i had to call some girl to give me a ride back home because we had no ride.  i got home and... passed right out. it was over.  tonight we're going to some big party @ eastern for a few hours then ending the night in ann arbor for uofm party.  *sigh* all of this partying.... but hey i'm meeting lots of new people.. doing lots of new things...  okay.. bye :)"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","i'm packing the apartment / plan to move out tomorrow / well at least move my belongings to my parents house (hopefully) and then set out to find a place to live.  being here i'm so far away from everything in the world that matters to me, i mean the only reason i was here .... was to convinence sal.  so i'm going back up north to be near my job, family, friends...not quite sure where i'm going to live right now i suppose an apartment is out of the question with capone being my sidekick - not too many apartment complexes are going to allow a german shepard... so a house is definitly my only option right now *sigh*.    sorry for the bad picture... camera phone... gotta love them ;)  okay thats it.  -goodnight"

""this"".    this sucks.. i hate it... but when i've come to these conclusions.. something is wrong.  i've lost hope.  whos knows.. we'll see how things go... its wednesday morning...see how many more days her and i are able to stand each other... i predict 4.  -goodnight"

(heh as i'm typing this capone just went in his cage and went to sleep).  so today i decided i was going to try and get a hold of my buddy that just got out of the army like last sunday... and i hadn't seen him - so i did / he came back down to my apartment with me and we did a lot of catching up.... none the less that was boring too :(  so i drove another 50 miles back up north to drop him off back at home (he decided to tell me he had a car on our way back).  heh its so funny / i realize that my days are so boring .... its my thoughts... my emotions... and basically how i think that seems to be so compelling... yet i find it hard ... to actually write about those in a public enviroment such as this.  *sigh*.  heh okay.  -goodnight"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004",my day *sigh* ;)
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","today we met up around 4... and it turned out to be a fruit bowl of emotions from the very begining.  a major part of me was happy to see you, and feels completed when your around - it just feels ""right"".  then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again.    in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.  but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.  although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the cvs to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, ""i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you"".  the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.  it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.  when i'm not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i've been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.  so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i'm not in her life - which i'm sure doesn't take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void.    as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i'm living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i ""lived in michigan"" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.  then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.  be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.  this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally.    this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn't do... but i do.  so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.  its sad really.  so i'm not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i'm going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.  we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we're able to survive this.  *sigh*"

""the story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many americans. but you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of congress.  because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. well, i'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in washington, d.c.  and when i'm president, america will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected â it is a right for all americans.""    very cool john:  ""i want to address these next words directly to president george w. bush: in the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. let's build unity in the american family, not angry division. let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in american history, the constitution of the united states.""    these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.  i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.  i'm looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before.    maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?  something i will consider :)  right now this is the place where i come to write, and right now, this minute... this is all i can think of writing about because it has consumed my day, and my thoughts.  for a full transcript of johns speech  urllink click here .  2008 i'll be part of this:    -goodnight."

(check out the pics) the first time i seen one was when i was visiting out in san francisco (sun sets right there), and the second one was here... the only thing that was missing... was while i was sitting there watching it... i was in another world wishing someone else was there sitting next to me, buttttttttttt yeah actually... that was the entire trip i wished she was there...   i didn't even see this picture until i got home and downloaded the pics, someone must have took it while i was there day dreaming...   we got back to the campsite and sat around the fire telling jokes and what not, it was quite wierd - for the first time in ... my entire life i felt like ... we were a family. then i realized lyndsey wasn't there, but it still felt good. i miss her.  anyways it was odd.  i woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and we went right back out to the sand dunes where we seen a car flip (no one was hurt) and .. we got some more amazing photos of these guys on dirt bikes... flying through the air... all around it was goooood fucking times... my first family vacation i can actually say i enjoyed (even though i did only last a day)... i enjoyed it.  would have enjoyed it more if you were there though..  so thats my post... hope you guys enjoy the pictures... here i'll make it easy here is a link   urllink click on sand dunes   sooooo thats my weekend, i wish i had more interesting things to say but i dont.  so... goodnight... and farewell!!  comment on pics  -peace  *ps* - i read  your  comment - thanks for the good luck wishes."
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","today was very uncomplicated.  around 7ish mike and i went to tiki bobs for nicks free party pass thing, we were able to drink for free until nine.. and we took advantage of that.  while i was there i ran into some old high school buddies which was fucking amazing cause i have anot seen them fucks in almost 5 or 6 years... so that was awesome.. we left tiki bobs and headed to rochester to the main street grill, where we all played each other in some pool.  we did have plans that followed main street, and that was to go see a movie, but that all changed when drinks got in us - we decided to roll back over to nicks house and play presidents and assholes... a drinking game, so we picked up a case on the way from cvs andddddd drank our asses off for a little while - i know i got fucked up pretty bad at one point, i had to lay my head on the couch and shut my eyes for a bit - but then i woke up, sobered up, drove home and most importantly made it home safe... its 3:21 am so i did good.  side note:  dont drink and drive - only fucking idiots do that shit!!!   one day i will practice what i preach until then think of my is king hypocrite, think of me however the fuck you want to think of me.. but i know a few of you guys that read this ... drink and are not even old enough to drink so.. let it me known... if you need a ride... call me see if i'm sober.. if i'm not... i'll pay for a taxi.. alright?  beat your fucking asses you drive drunk... lyndsey..kelly... dana....jessica..  okay so that is my night... i think i'm going to go to sleep now... so goodnight."
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","well yesterday was kellys birthday - she was totally not looking forward to it, i happened to read her journal and just felt bad for her, so i made sure i was the first one to wish her a happy birthday :p .  apparently she got a expensive digital cam for her birthday, can't be mad at that kel :p  anyways hope you had a happy birthday - you were in my thoughts :)  i'm not sure what is going on with my dad.  after all the drama i wake up to emails from him inviting me to go camping with him this weekend - i was a bit shocked.  i ended up calling him, and found out chad (my brother) was going to be over there, so i shot over there and hung out for awhile.  ending up laying in the pool for a little while then i had to take off.  it was relaxing just to be in a pool, its been awhile - haha i love to swim so much.  this past winter my old sidekick and i ran up in hotels and used them for their pool, and then we would bounce and go home.  it was gangster.  anyways so yeah it was nice to fucking lay out in the pool.    left there came home and just got really lazy and bored.  it was.. disgusting really.  at some point i think around 10:30 i decided to go out and went over to tonic for a little while, had a few drinks, danced, but the most interesting part of the whole entire night i would have to say was....  i was up at the bar just kind of observing the dance floor, when i noticed this black man walk by me - wearing this necklace that was blinding, straight bling.  as i looked up at his face, it was almost as if recognizing a child hood friend - obie trice was a hand length away from me... as i looked at him he looked at me.. i kind of grinned like.. i know who you are none of these fuckers do.. i was like whats up man.. anyways we ended up talking for about 10 minutes - i told him his cd was one of the better cd's to come off the shady imprint since the eminem show, he smiled and said ""listen to this..."" and pulled a cd out of his pocket - it is just a burned cd straight out of the lab, bad ass song - produced my eminem.  he ended the conversation by saying, ""alright man i have to get up there.."" (v.i.p) - it was dope.. but the dopest part after he walked away from me, he came back like 5 seconds later and was like whats your name again... who knows small world whatever.. he dont remember it now..  sooo i'm home now... been home for awhile... waiting for lynn to get online because i really wanna talk to her... she is on the phone right now :(  so thats just about where my night stands right now... i'm watching the dave chappelle show - erika badu or however you spell her name is doing a performance... alright well.. i'm out like a thief in the night :)  -night. ps. let me know what you guys think of the new look. :)"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","why am i up?  its 3:30 in the fucking morning there is no need for me to be up.  nothing entertaining is going on, there is no one to talk to online, and most importantly, i have a lot of things that i need to accomplish tomorrow.  why am i still up?  who the fuck knows.  the more i think about it, the more i fear i'll never get tired, so here i am - in an attempt to do something which ordinarily relaxes me :)  the stuff party last night was pretty dope.  by now the majority of you guys have seen the pictures, so you know it was looking like a good time.  to answer all of your questions at once, the band that was playing was darren mcarty's band (he is a defenseman for the detroit redwings) - they were alright.  the best part of the entire night was the fact that i got fucked up - i hardly drank a drop, but when it came to smoking - i smoked.  it was ... wonderful :)  i danced the majority of the night after the band got done playing - as a matter of fact i could not find it in me to stop dancing, i just danced... and danced... and danced.  came home, posted real quick, and crashed.  today was fun. mike and i went to the rec center and practiced dodge ball, well that was the plan but seeings a lot of people did not show up we substituted our game for a quick run of the gym hitting the weights, and then for a quick game of one on one basketball.  so regardless we got our workout on.  we ended our wonderful day at arbys where we picked up dinner.  the minute i got home i showered because i was extremely hot.  that was fucking amazing - orgasmic really.  so now i'm up and i can't sleep.  but now i've posted, so maybe i'm relaxed enough to try again.  alright here i go ... 1... 2... 3...  latah.  ps.  i couldn't be happier with life right now :)"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","today was busy.  i'm not use to busy days :)  it was nice.  mike and i took the girls back to baycity.. we stopped for lunch on the way home at a & w i didn't realize how good their fucking food was - i was diggin that place.  anyways i started the drive... and with the lack of sleep and the honestly not really paying attention... about 25 minutes into the trip... mike says, ""dude we're going north.."" so yeah.  i wasted alot of time driving in the completely opposite direction of home, so i pulled over and was like ""your driving"".  so i got the chill for a few hours on the ride home - it was relaxing although i didn't get to sleep as i had planned i was to caught up in the music... that happens sometimes.     after we got back home we chilled for a few minutes, and went directly to my dads house to go pick up all of my shit that he was storing for me - that was fun.  he is such a fucking idiot - he emails me and plays this hardass, that doesn't give a fuck about his kids, implies he pretty much hates us, and then when i show up expecting the worst he is going to act like he is my best friend.  what the fuck.  i said maybe two words to him, for the first 20 minutes while we packed up the back of mikes truck - and then all of the sudden i think he kind of detected that there was some tension coming his way from me - and he out of know where offered me to use his van with the trailer so i only had to make one trip... awww how nice of you pops, its the least you could fucking do.  i'm not going to complain, it made things a hell of a lot easier on time.   so i got to mikes and just threw all of my shit in the garage where i'm going to store it for now... i think i'll break into it tomorrow or something.. i don't know.  its going to be nice to have my desktop back though.      anyways.  so i left back towards my parents house to return the van and i heard a song... and the fucking song just fucked with me, i've heard it so many fucking times in the past but i've never listened to it - this time i listened to it ... and it fits... i dedicate to my parents (staind - for you).  got back with the van and my dad had company over, so as i went to go give him the keys and let him know i was leaving he became dad of the year and offered me dinner.  i was fucking shocked.  (no matter how much i hate you i can't turn down free food.)  so i ate.  then he said, ""why don't you party with us tonight..."" i almost started having seizures.  i think it is so funny that he thinks he can pop in my life and out of my life playing the dad role when its convient for him.  when no one is around and he is just miserable, he don't like me, or us for that matter.  but god damnit if his friends are around he is a ""cool dad"".  fuck you.  i hate you.        your a piece of shit of an excuse for a dad and i regret every single day of giving you another chance to be there and be a dad  ... i should have went with my fucking mom to florida.    i fucking hate him  .  but he don't think anything is wrong with him, he thinks everybody else is wrong.  lets look at the facts.      i moved out when i was 16  chad moved out when he was 17  lyndsey just moved out (she just turned 17)  kristyn left the day she turned 18   wow, i notice a fucking pattern.  blah.  i fucking hate him.  anyways so that was my night... well there was more but i can't talk about it cause it just don't involve me and it wouldn't be very nice of me to divulge other peoples business... ya know?  so yeah.  hope you enjoyed my post... its the first one in awhile that i'm venting in.  i'm pissed, i can vent right?  i can't be cool all the time.. shit gets exhausting ha.... alright enjoy ya'lls weekend :)"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","ok, can i just talk about gw bush the 'good ole boy'?  i mean, come on...  gw bush went to andover. and yale. he's from greenwich, connecticut.  he vacations in maine.  and don't get me wrong, andover, yale, greenwich, and maine are all lovely places.  but they're not exactly breeding grounds for 'good ole boys' who drive rusty pickup trucks and herd cattle(gw bush most likely grew up stealing golf carts and occasionally riding polo ponies, both of which are fine adolescent, preppy pursuits, but are not the sort of pursuits that people associate with good ole boys from deep in the heart of texas).  it just galls me when gw goes out and plays cowboy and some of the voters actually believe that he's a man of the people.  gw bush exists to serve his billionaire masters, and that's it.  so the next time you see gw pretending to be a good ole boy or a man of the people just remember that he grew up summering in good ole greenwich connecticut getting drunk on golf courses and bragging about his rich daddy.  if gw bush is a cowboy from texas then i'm a weight-lifter from siberia.   just seen him on the news and got annoyed.   -goodnight"
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","for the first time in forever i forgot my phone in my car.  this is normal, as i'm sure that many of you reading this have done this as well.  it is abnormal for me though - ever since the bullshit... my phone is plugged in and charges in the same room as i am while i'm sleeping... well last night i forgot it in my car.  which i suppose shows progress... i mean before i'd get dressed up to go back outside and grab it before i goto bed... but last night, not a thought in my head about it.    so if that is any type of measure of my progress i suppose its a good steady incline of my overall progress, right?   there were a few 'firsts' for everything today.  when i woke up the first thing i did was look for my phone, which was as i said - out in my car.  so i grabbed a cigerette and walked outside - go to my phone.. and someone called me @ 5 am... private name.  i have a very  strong  feeling who it was...and that to me is irony.  the first time i leave my phone in the car, she decides to call.. if that isn't a sign.  anyways.. i hope everything is fine with you, and everything is okay.  i remember what the '5 a.m.' phone calls are about.. and i hope your night was alright, drama free.  sorry i didn't pick up.  none the less...   there is nothing else to post.  -goodnight"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","""honesty"" it is something that i'm learning.  for in the past i would have been 'afraid' of sarah's reaction to ""the truth"" - but now i speak of nothing but, and the reaction is... at first is understanding and support - but the long term reaction is her disappearing out of my life.  do i regret telling her the truth? not at all.  you see truth is always the best policy and the reward is often so much more than you expect.  yes it sucks that she does not want to see me or hang out with me because it sucks for her, but at least she knows that i was real with her - and we aren't ending for any ""odd"" reason for which she couldn't understand or comprehend.. we are ending because everything was put out in the open with my feelings - and it is simple to understand.  i miss her though *shrugs* but its best.  i think that was just considered, 'rambling' was it not?    anyways.  so today was pretty lame. (as i'm typing this capone is laying on the bed with me ... making funny noises looking at me wanting to go to sleep - fuck i love him).  i stayed home most of the day... oh wait.  at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.  capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.     so back to my day.  i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.  got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly's apartment and watched ""ghost ship"" that is an alright flick.  not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.  one of those things.    i'm feeling better about everything.  i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the 'cloud' that over shadowed sarah and i's friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.  your thinking, ""what cloud?"" - well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?  we have all been there.  so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.  i wasn't ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.  so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.   i'm going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.   -goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy!"

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","last night i went to lush barroom again.  that was kind of cool.  afterwards i went to kellys apartment and attempted to watch fight club. left there came home let capone outside, where he got bit by ants so i had to give him a bath at 6 am. fun? no.  then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn't end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.  sucked.    today i'm going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the 'techofest' which should be a blast, i'm excited for it anyways.  we'll see how that goes.  bye.   does he kiss you and give you butterflys? do you see your future when you look in his eyes? when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man? when you lay down does he play with your hair? when ever hes gone are wishing he was there? when you fuck each other do you think of me? do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve? when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides? does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares? when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far? would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you? would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true? do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look? does he know what gets you going like he has read your book? when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face? when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place? do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me? do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve? do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream? do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back? do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you? do you ever wonder if i'm still in love? do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs? do you ever wonder if im fucking? do you even care who i'm hugging?  does he kiss you and give you butterflies? or is it just a coverup of how you really feel inside?  it is for me."
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","its 10:17 pm and i'm sitting here with capone.  lots of invites out tonight but i really felt the need to just relax tonight - my body feels so exhausted.  which is odd.  i eat better now than i have in the past year.  yesterday for example sarah grilled me some ribs, the day before that she grilled me some chicken cabobs, the day before that she grilled me some steak.  as i write this i'm wiping away juice from a fruit cocktail i just made after an extreme grocery purchase at meijers.  i often think to myself, sally would be happy to see how i'm living now opposed to how i was while we were together - but then i think to myself i wouldn't be living this way if she was here - i'd be too focused on other things.   so i'm not doing anything tonight - at all.  no sarah, no club, no bar, no drinking, no nothing.  me and my homie capone... chillin.. about to turn on the tv and see whats on.. probably fall into a deeeeep sleep.  blah. im not in a good mood.  -blah fucking blah.. goodnight."
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","mike, sarah, and i went to this club tonight.  it was the awesome!!  we ended up first of all walking in, not having to stand in a line - then i met the two girls that run the production company who hosted the party... and they gave us free drinks all night - i think between the three of us we bought... 1 drink.  we all got drunk very very very very cheap.  great music, great people, great atmosphere.. it was just as dope as it could be.  actually tonight was amazing.  i wish i would have taken my camera into the club so you could see pictures of mike breaking it down - hahaha i even got into the action.. we were having such a blast.  i danced with dana, it made sarah act a little wierd - that lasted for about 20 seconds i think when she realized i didn't really care what she thought - because i'm not going to be all up on her.. or any female for that matter ever again.  i'm gonna have fun and do what i want... because thats how its suppose to be.  so she didn't say anything to me and chilled out - and we ended up having a really goodnight.  we left there, dropped off sarah... and mike and i hit up the taco bell in waterford.  lol drunk and eating..it was such a good idea.  sarah? yes here is a picture sarah  so this is sarah.. she is dope.. very sweet.. very kind... and she is  very  independent. :)  anyways.. thats my day / night... and.. now i'm out like a gangster in a cop movie.. peaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!  oh wait. thought i would mention.... stuff magazine party.. detroit... july 17th... catch me in the august issue... i will be sittin v.i.p with mikey and the family... hahaha i'm psyched!!!  -peace"
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"01,August,2004","today was kind of fun.  mike and i went to the 'village square' which is a mall based outside.  very neat.  it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the a/c.  *sigh*.  capone got some training today.  he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.  neat eh?  i guess the 'training' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.  he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.  i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.  after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah's house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.  we then proceeded to go to nick's house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.  came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).  i'm beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.  i feel like i'm slowing down time.. or i'm speeding up with it, and i'm beginning to catch up with everything about me.  is there still some things i want to change? of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute. (blah i'm rambling).  what i'm really trying to say is... i'm becoming more focused ... i'm becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.  today on the way home from sarah's house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.  wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.  now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i've had to deal with, but i wasn't as wise then - in fact i was nieve.  through this i've become more wise, and less nieve.  i will never gamble ""myself"" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.  never again.  so i'm becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.  i've become more wise.. and since you can't learn wisdom, and you can't teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i'm growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose.    -goodnight.  ps. new picture of capone... more on my pictures page."

9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"03,August,2004","this post will not be long tonight i don't think, but then again who the fuck knows.  my mood the last few days has been quite cynical.  which does not make sense since right this moment, i have more going for me in my life than i have in months.  i don't get it.  anyways i already posted about this but i made it private.  sorry i do keep somethings private, when i know its in my best interest.  sue me.  it is so hard for me to sit here and write, without venting.  i've written 3 lines and just erased them.    today was interesting.  i got the job i've wanted forever.  yes, caught you off guard did it not?  i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of 'doubt' with getting the job.  today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.  he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.  i'm fucking geeked.  i have to tell mah people now that i'm going to be leaving them, they will get over it.  so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.  i will post more later on that subject.    after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn't the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k? :)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.  after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.  we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.  because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.  it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.  maybe one day i'll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn't even wanna talk about it.  because it is so personal and deep.  oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the ""random"" folder.  i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i'm not going to tell you how.   i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i'd feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn't kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i'd be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.   that just came out as i was typing the post.  sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don't think you'll find a negetive one so i think i'm entitled to being 'down' once in awhile... this was my night.  dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.  comments are off on this one.   -goodnight"
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"02,August,2004","today was interesting to say the least.  i felt like i needed ""alone time"" today.  i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.  it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.  it was peaceful.  on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.  so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.  went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.  i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn't trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.  so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.  tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i'm totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.  it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.  so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven't checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now.    clownsteve: you get the pics downloaded? kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass out   so i guess i'll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.  they are funny.  okay i'm in for the night.   -latah"
9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml,"02,August,2004","before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight   ""can you imagine if peter parker was high?""    ""steve this thing is so long and big""  (burrito at taco bell)   ""is this the cd?  no. then how are you starting it over? im not, its the radio.""  (eminem - stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.  so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some ""goods"" we went and smoked, in kelly's apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it'd be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can't write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.  it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.  the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.  who knows.  tonight was pretty intoxicating though.  i don't think i've laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.  in a real long time.  but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.  there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.  it was fun.  i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.  especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.  anyways so i'm home now its 3:42 am.  saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.  it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.  yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.  it was sad.  she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.  she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn't let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.  called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.  none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.  it takes a lot of stress away.  so we partied there that night for a little while.   haha i put saturday first.  friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.  i didn't end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.  so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.  the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.  2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.  well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.  oh well - couldn't change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.  it was fun.  then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.  i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo.    so that was my weekend.  and thats the end of my post.  -cheers.

""sometimes the people in charge of the religion,"" he said, ""get so wrapped up in the rules that they forget about the message. the message of godde, of christ, is ultimately about love for your fellow man."" a few weeks later, michael broke down another barrier of prejuidice that resided inside me. he told me that he was hiv positive. i remember that we had been sharing a basket of french fries and i was paralyzed with fear at the thought of contracting the disease. now, i realize that it was a naive and foolish fear, but at that time it was a life-altering experience, because it showed me that who you sleep with is insignificant in the grand scheme of life.  i never saw michael after that semester. i tried to track him down several times, but never succeeded and i have moments when i wonder if he is even still walking among us. i am convinced that he was an angel, a messenger sent to me by godde to teach me about compassion, honesty, and love. in light of recent events that have taken place within my community of faith, i have thought about my friendship with michael more and more and i often wonder what he would think of all this controversy surrounding a gay man that wants to bring people closer to godde. to me it is clear that godde places people in our lives to teach, inspire, and make us better human beings. godde does not discriminate and i am very proud of the episcopal church for recognizing that truth by ordaining gene robinson. i will stand by my church and my faith, regardless of the political ramifications that come from this decision. it is my firm belief that, eventually, we will all have to answer for our actions. to the individuals that are quick to suggest that gene robinson will be punished by godde for his relationship with a man, may i remind you all that casting judgement is also considered to be a sin. instead of pointing fingers, learn from this man. open your hearts and embrace the message that is being sent to you."

11762.female.25.Student.Aries.xml,"26,May,2004","sunday evening, i went to church for the first time since my confirmation in june. it is pathetic and sad, how distracted i became this past summer. lust overcame my heart and i pulled away from godde, deserting my faith for the simple pleasures of the skin. yet, when the inevitable happened and that man disappeared from my life, i found myself clinging to my faith like a life-raft. godde became my glue and she held me together during that horrible time, when i felt him slip through my fingers. godde continues to hold me together as i am writing these words.  it felt like coming home when i received communion. i could feel this overwhelming sense of purpose and direction flood through my body, melting into my soul. when i tasted the bread, for the first time in months, it had a dry bitter flavor, but it connected me with the others in the church. when i drank the wine, i could feel the blood of christ renewing me, strenghtening me, preparing me for the road ahead. catholics believe that the eucharist involves the process of transubstantiation, where the bread and wine are, literally, the body and blood of christ. episcopalians recognize this belief, but tend to view the eucharist as a symbolic act, rather than a literal one.  in my opinion, christianity is about the blessing of this sacrament. long before there were numerous denominations, the early christians were meeting in secret to receive bread and wine. they risked persecution, even became martyrs, for this simple act. the eucharist is an invisible rope that, through this acknowledgement of the sacrifice of christ, binds christians to one another.  growing up in a southern baptist tradition, i received communion during two services a year, christmas and easter. i never considered communion to be an active part of the faith and when i started attending services at the episcopal church, i thought it strange that episcopalians received the eucharist every single sunday without fail. now, i can no longer imagine going to church and not receiving communion before i go out into the world. it is the ultimate business card,  please, take our savior with you. his body and blood are yours, if you wish to carry it inside of you . it is an incredible gift.  this is the reason that i am a christian. the eucharist brought me comfort when my relationship with gene was falling apart. i know that there are a number of theological interpretations within the world-wide christian community, so many that at times it seems as if that community will fall apart. the eucharist is what binds us together in the face of adversity and change. it is an integral part of the faith. it is what brings christians back into the church, even after they have been gone for days, weeks, months, and even years.  it is a blessing. it is home."

11762.female.25.Student.Aries.xml,"26,May,2004","there are some occasions for which hallmark has no appropriate card to give to another human being. there is no card that expresses a proper sentiment for the friend who has been laid off from work for the second time in three years, for the woman who choses to have an abortion and struggles with that decision for the rest of her life, or for the man who is diagnosed with hiv and is forced to reconcile himself with the fact that he is dying.  there is no card for my friend, and co-worker, nancy who was diagnosed with cancer and has spent the last three years battling this disease. last week, i discovered that her doctor found four tumors in nancy's brain and that her chances of living to see another year are very slim. i am struggling with the injustice of this revelation. it is times like these that cause me to question godde's purpose for people. is this kind of action the definition of mercy? is it right for a woman, an individual who has never been anything but wonderful to her co-workers and friends, to suffer in such a manner? how does a person live out the remainder of their life, knowing that with each rotation of the sun they are one day closer to leaving behind all that they have ever known?  sometimes, there are simply no words for the moment, no words to describe the shock you feel at learning that a person in your life will no longer be there to grace you with their smile. there are no words for the sadness, the frustration, and the anger that is felt when good people are forced to suffer and carry an unbearable burden, while the dregs of humanity walk the world and feel no consequences for their actions.  this is the hardest part about being a person of faith, not the theology that you adhere to nor the manner in which you daily practice the rituals of your religion, but the need to keep your hand tight around the tenuous thread of hope. the most difficult thing in the world is to have faith when the entire world tries to pull you away from it."

11762.female.25.Student.Aries.xml,"26,May,2004","procrastination, to be sure, is an artform.  it is one that i have cultivated through many years of school, secondary and post-secondary education.  there are days when it seems that i will never be motivated enough to pursue academia and then there are moments where it feels as though i am meant to be nothing but an academic, that scholarship and research will be my life.   the hard part about going to graduate school on a part-time basis is finding the time to live.  when you are an undergraduate student, your job is school and your life is a separate entity.  when you work for a living and go to school at night, school, suddenly, becomes your life.  all other aspects of daily living fall by the wayside and you are plunged into a monotonous routine of work and school, work and school, work and school.   procrastination, as a result, becomes more than an artform.  it becomes as essential to life and breathing air and drinking water.  it becomes sex, something that we do not need to survive, but is something that we cannot imagine living without.   therefore, one could conclude, procrastination is nothing short of fucking with our own self."

'few opportunities' but the izaak walton cottage chapter, who have set up a charitable trust to fund the running of the cottage, said they were upset the council had not met them before making the decision. tony bridgett, president of the chapter, said: ""the council threatened to close the cottage 18 months ago and there was a campaign run by the people of stafford and ourselves to keep it open. ""so in some respects we are delighted that it is staying open. ""but it is only going to open from may to the end of august, and only on saturdays and sundays and not bank holidays so members of the public are going to get very few opportunities to visit. ""we have some money available and the council say they haven't got any but they haven't got round to meeting us so we are able to mutually work together."" members of the council's leisure scrutiny committee will debate the plans next week. a spokeswoman for the council said the hours had been revised to take into account when visitors most used the cottage. she said a range of events will continue to be held at the cottage and coach trips, including schools, would still be able to visit during the week."

''  a key ruling in the 2-year-old case -- which could determine whether the two sides settle or forge ahead to a jury trial -- is expected at any time, say patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit.  advertising made up about 95 percent of google's $1 billion in revenue last year. if the company loses the patent suit, it would probably have to pay damages, license technology from yahoo or alter how it manages its ad system.  overture, then known as goto.com, filed its patent in may 1999 for a ``system and method for influencing a position on a search result list.'' the 43-page patent application details a system in which advertisers would be able to bid for better placement of ads in search-engine results and manage their accounts through a web browser.  the u.s. patent office awarded the patent july 31, 2001.  in february 2002, google introduced its adwords program -- a system that would eventually help reshape internet advertising and legitimize search engines as a viable business. with adwords, advertisers bid for the right to certain keywords. when a google user types in that keyword as part of a search, the advertiser's pitch shows up near the results.  a tour operator in hawaii, for example, might buy the terms ``hawaii,'' ``vacation,'' ``volcano'' and ``beach,'' and its ads will appear next to google search results for those terms. advertisers bid against one another for keywords, with higher bidders getting better ad placement.  in its suit, filed in april 2002, overture says google is ``willfully'' and ``directly infringing'' on its patent. the company is seeking triple damages.  google, which is in a mandated ``quiet period'' leading up to its ipo, declined to comment on the suit, as did attorneys representing both companies.  but in court documents, the company denies overture's allegations. among other things, google is claiming that overture was using its advertising system for more than a year before it filed for its patent. patent law gives people a year to file patents after inventing something; a late filing automatically invalidates the patent.  patent attorneys who have reviewed court documents have mixed views on overture's chances of prevailing.  mitchell rosenfeld, a patent attorney with capstone law group in san mateo, said google has submitted substantial evidence to show that overture missed the one-year deadline.  rosenfeld said a key issue in the case could end up being whether overture was testing its technology or using a finished product.  on the other hand, overture needs only to prove that google infringed on one of the 67 claims in its patent. also, overture's patent application appears to have been well-researched by both the company and the patent office, said bruce sunstein of bromberg & sunstein in boston.  ``this is going to be a patent that is relatively difficult to knock out,'' sunstein said.  since late march, u.s. district judge jeffrey white, a former patent attorney, has been analyzing the scope and meaning of overture's patent, poring over each word and studying terminology such as ``database'' and ``search result list.'' it's a crucial step before a jury can be asked to decide whether a company has infringed on a patent. a ruling could come any day.  known as ``markman'' rulings, these decisions are often tipping points in patent cases, said patent attorney john ferrell, co-founder of carr & ferrell in palo alto.  if the judge does not agree with one side's interpretation of the patent language, it will often push to settle the suit, he said.  the case is especially intriguing now that internet search engines have become big business. when the suit was filed two years ago, overture was suing an up-and-coming search engine with an unproven business model.  today, google is considered the king of internet search. and overture's stature increased when yahoo acquired the company for $1.83 billion in stock and cash, incorporating its advertising technology and patents into its services.  ``it's one of those things that two or three years ago wouldn't have been an issue,'' said andy beal, vice president of search marketing for websourced. ``but it just goes to show you how big search is.''  about half of all patent verdicts are overturned on appeal. and the stakes are high. ultimately, the two sides will have to weigh the costs of a prolonged legal fight -- attorney bills in a case like this could reach $1 million a year -- against the possibility of losing.  ``my observation is that there is this big lawsuit between two enormous players,'' ashby said, ``and no one is paying attention to it.''"

8173.male.42.indUnk.Capricorn.xml,"02,August,2004","fuck that flag  a short story by the mutant.  this is a true story, or so i have been led to believe. it was told to the mutant by his friend ""jack"". jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as ""flag worship"".  i should mention that my friend jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.  jack is a mechanic. he works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. he keeps the machinery running and he likes his job. jack is fighting terrorism his way.  a few days before the anniversary of 9/11, jack was approached by his employer with a nice new american flag.  ""jack, i just bought a flag.""  jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, ""i am happy for you. what does this mean to me?""  ""you are the mechanic,"" says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic. ""can you build us a flagpole?""  ""yeah, i suppose i could. but it will take time away from working on our vehicles. i am not doing this on my own time.""  ""of course.""  and so, jack set off to build a flagpole. jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer. he has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company. but he got on with it anyway.  jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth. based on these figures, jack produced a flagpole atop the office. old glory fluttered in the breeze. sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, jack puffed with satisfaction on his marlboro.  but all was not well my friends. no. for as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.  in the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, jack's flagpole was 'half-assed', a first year student's attempt at an art form best left to professionals. the office dwellers complained to jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.  ""it's not that bad,"" says jack. ""no one can see that, it still looks ok.""  ""it's a brand new flag. it has to come down until you make the pole higher,"" says the employer.  ""that will cost more money and more time. an extension will have to be added to the pole. and i will have to build a new bracket.""  ""that's fine, do whatever you need to do.""  and so jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof. satisfied with his work, jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.  the flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered jack's accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.  ""jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?""  ""who is that going to impress?"" says jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.  ""what?"" the sickness affects hearing first. ""we should have lights shine on our flagpole. can you do that?""  i'll kill this shit thinks jack, ""yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work.""  ""that's ok.""  ""is it? the electrician has to come out of the city. it will cost more time and more money.""  the increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer's brain, ""money is not the issue. do whatever you need to do.""  jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set. in the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof. a mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers. the peaceful nastiness of jack's garage was once again shattered.  jack's employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager. by this time, the sickness was in full bloom. the office worker's need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries. it was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied. they needed more.  the office manager confronted jack, ""we want to erect a new flagpole. how soon can you get it up there?""  ""look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it's going to be a problem. we will have to weld it. our welder will have to weld the poles and we'll have to mount it on the roof very securely. we are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem. we need to bail on this deal. this flag is a bad idea. it has been nothing but trouble.""  the manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred. they decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot. and they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.  and so it was that jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.  an interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday. this is no problem he thought, i just won't be anywhere dangerous on that day. but the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy. he's done his part for his country. and now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.  the welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed. the poles jack has been using on the roof won't do.  being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening. it must then be folded into a triangle. and what's more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.  jack thinks this is fine idea. jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time. indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on. his brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.  jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.  the welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. no. they must take the flag to the vfw hall. there they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.  the welder took the flag with him to the vfw hall, so if you don't get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why. sickness takes a toll.  soon thereafter, jack is called into an office meeting. he stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth. jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty. as he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.  ""what is this all about? i'm busy,"" he grumbles.  ""we need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag,"" says the office manager.  ""what flag?""  ""this is important. we need to decide how this will be handled.""  ""do i have this right? i had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?""  the office manager can't take it anymore, ""can i see you in here for a moment?""  they go into a private office.  ""geez jack, what are you a communist?""  ""no. i am a nazi.""  ""oh god, jack, don't say things like that. people don't think that kind of talk is funny.""  ""ja, i am really.""  ""look jack, it's just a little flag.""  ""no. if i have a little flag on a wooden stick,"" waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, ""that is a little flag. you are holding a meeting for something that does not exist. i have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight am tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do.""  ""i get it, ok. go.""  and go he did. the manager returned to the meeting, ""i don't know. i guess he's just un-patriotic...""  indeed. i am jack's complete lack of patriotism.  the sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, ""jack is un-american. jack is a communist. must be a democrat. child abuse, i heard. a satanist..."" they just could not understand it. why would anyone hate the flag so much?  thou shalt have no other god before me. unless it's the flag. amen.  jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring jack back into the fold. jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.  ""how much money have you spent on this flag deal?""  ""well, the flag was a hundred dollars.""  ""and you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag.""  the boss can't believe this, ""it can't be that much."" sick people can't count.  ""go figure.""  he did. the boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have. isn't that special?  now. the electrician. remember the electrician? the electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn't there, on the flagpole, that also isn't there.  jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the vfw hall. he also advised him that if these people didn't get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.  the office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go. since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable. he also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag. sickness causes laziness.  the electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done. and in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights. no doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.  since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.  enter the boss's idiot son.  the boss's son has never operated a ditcher. but since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn. are you getting ahead of me yet?  so he's running the ditcher. once it starts it's pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary. jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.  ""the line turns back there,"" jack yells over the machine noise, ""don't you need to turn the ditcher now?""  ""yeah, i'm going to turn it over here, in a minute.""  jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it. just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise. sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.  the power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby. the phones aren't working either. no cable tv. and all eight-hundred feet of the dsl fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher's impeller.   now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the dsl cannot easily be fixed. the repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them. and then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.  meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the dsl is down, (don't ask me why). so, no money coming in.  the computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of jack's computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.  once the crisis had passed, jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was. jack is funny that way.  ""fuck that flag,"" the boss said.  it is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.  three-thousand dollars. for a flag they didn't have. on a flagpole they also didn't have.  is there a point to my story? well, fuck if i know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don't you?  we were talking about sickness. when illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can. sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.  the mental illness of ""flag worship"" is different. only a really good beating will get it out of your system.  well anyway, that's jack's prescription.  ---the happy ending---  jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers. he went through the office passing them out.  ""one for you, and one for you..."" he sang as he went along.  he reached the office manager with the last one, ""and one for you...""  ""all right! i know just where to put it,"" said the office manager, slapping the american flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor. ""that's great!""  indeed it was. and pretty strange behavior for a communist too, don't you think?"

(to dispel any confusion it was not mr mandal, but prime minister vp singh who actually implemented the commision report and is thus reviled for the reason).  i probably will never want to come back here again, simply because there is nothing to come back to."

9470.male.25.Communications-Media.Aries.xml,"03,July,2003","some months ago, when i was with bccl, (the publisher of the times of india and he economic times), i had a conversation with cto of the group internet company, times internet limited. who asked me to put down some thoughts on how i see things on the internet shaping up. while i did put down those thoughts, i never actually sent it to him, the file was lying around till i came across it a couple of days back.  here is a rewrite of what i initially penned down (typed up?).   a lot of rambling about nothing in particular.    the positioning of a product or service is more and more targeted to more and more specific audiences? case in point are the bmw and mercedes, both are from fine german engineering pedigree, both are premium luxury cars. however the buyers of the two will probably as different as two people can be. the former will be bought by a person who will drive the car himself and the latter probably by someone who has a chauffer (yes, i know mercedes also makes sports cars this is the general perception that i expressed here). such a huge differentiation in mindset is what branding is all about. this trend is seen in media as well. the rise of niche publications in developed economies such as the us and uk is illustrative of this.   any media would broadly undergo the distinct phases of consolidation in the growth phase and then  fragmentation once the medium matures. the internet is perhaps one medium which fragmented even before it matured. this is perhaps explained by the global reach of the media and the fact that ideas can be easily replicated across geographical & political boundaries; i.e. something that works in america, will almost certainly not work in india, simply because the maturity of the american market is of a different order of magnitude. to illustrate this point further the existence and flourishing of sites like epinions.com (in the american context) and the apparent non-starter of the indian equivalent mouthshut.com which are sources of information.  or price comparison sites like mysimon.com which as far as i know has no comparable indian site.   with this brief background, it would be instrumental to see the whole internet game in a different perspective . the internet tends to promote the formation of groups of people with very specific interests. a sort of mother of all niche publications, which you can talk back to and whats more it talks back to you and allows you to communicate with your peer group.   while the bennet philosophy has been to be an aggregator of audiences by subsidizing the price the audience pays to retrieve content and then retrieving profit from the purchasing those audiences. this can prove counter productive as far as the internet goes, as the internet has people who are used to getting content for free and are likely to freeload. on the other hand the audience which does pay to retrieve the content would then be most prized and wanted by an advertiser, if nothing to prove non frivolousness of their transaction with us. the idea would be to convince the mass populace that information is of value. the easiest way to ensure that is to look for focused verticals in the information segment. the first one that comes to mind is economictimes.com or more accurately perhaps the work of etig.   the biggest problem that one can make out is how will people pay for it online. multimodal payment mechansims are already in use by the indiatimes family of websites. virtual currency of some kind can perhaps be also created for this purpose.   what about the business we are in?    content can take several forms, one of the forms could be that of blogs (such as the one you are reading right now). blogs are the latest rage in america, now spreading to other parts of the world. blogs are nothing but a personal running commentary on the world in general and sometimes specific to a topic.   another form could be in the form of reviews. reviews can be on any topic, from the palces to party & eat out in delhi to where to find the best shoes in chandini chowk. ineractivity which needs to be the cornerstone of such an offering. such content may well be in the form of a blog.   traditional content in the form of newspapers, tv, radio will definitely migrate in one form or the other to the web. evolution of devices like the microsoft tablet pc or the handspring treo are definitely a step in that direction.   in that respect standardisation under one name a la indiatimes.com is probably the biggest single mistake being undertaken by us and many others across the world. this conclusion is based on our initial premise that internet promotes the formation of specific focus groups. by definition these focus groups would be unlikey to turn to a general interest portal to get their kicks so to speak. the creation of multiple brands would be a better branding and strategic idea, having a ghoomnahai.com rather than having something like indiatimes travel. this gives an identity to the content and makes it more valued by its consumers.   the above, when seen in the overall context of evolution of media, is a perfectly logical sequence of events. growing media consolidates, and then fragments. during the growth phase it is perfectly acceptable to have a single brand name, but the moment the medium matures (maybe in the context of the limited audience it gathers in the indian scenario)   show me the money!!!   whether people will pay to read (& someday in the future see) such content is debatable. the likes of al ries would have us believe that advertising will never work on the internet (which is something i disagree with strongly). so what will happen? will the internet become a subversive medium which will undermine modern society as we know it. a sort of a no mans land where no content will be paid for? products and services being the only ones able to draw any sort of revenue?   the truth as the immortal words form x files go is out there...  my personal suspicion is that heavily prized content a la nyt or wsj will not only be paid for, but will also attract significant advertising revenues. for the rest, creation of strong niches will allow them to do the same   ps: don't hesitate to comment..."

9470.male.25.Communications-Media.Aries.xml,"18,October,2003","the festival of lights  this is one of the oldest hindu festivals occuring in the month of kartik, which commemorates the return of rama to ayodhya after an exile of 14 years. it also marks the beginning of the new year and is celebrated with the lighting of lamps. diwali or deepawali, literally 'an array of lamps', is the festival of lights and is celebrated on the darkest night of kartik. it is perhaps the most important festival in india. originally a hindu festival, it has now crossed the bounds of religion and is celebrated by all in india with fervor and gaiety. this day is a public holiday all over india.  twinkling oil lamps or diyas light up every home and firework displays are common all across the country. the goddess lakshmi (consort of vishnu), who is the symbol of wealth and prosperity, is also worshipped on this day. this festive occasion also marks the beginning of the hindu new year and lord ganesha, the elephant-headed god, the symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom, is also worshipped in most hindu homes on this day.  another view is that deepawali is meant to celebrate the destruction of the arrogant tyrant bali at the hands of vishnu when the latter appeared in his vamana (dwarf) avatar. the occasion of deepawali sees the spring-cleaning and white-washing of houses; decorative designs or rangolis are painted on floors and walls. new clothes are bought and family members and relatives gather together to offer prayers, distribute sweets and to light up their homes.   diwali is also perhaps the oldest festival still celebrated today and is mentioned in the ramayana. the celebrations include the lighting of lamps and candles, and the bursting of crackers (fireworks). friends and neighbours exchange special sweets. people buy new clothes and in fact, in certain communities, it is absolutely essential to wear new clothes on this day.  diwali in india is equivalent to christmas in the west. therefore it is also the time when people get the festival bonus to their salaries. it marks the beginning of the new year for a large majority of hindus, especially the trader community.  preparations for the festival begin many days prior to diwali. it is time for a thorough cleaning of the house, for the belief is that lakshmi will enter clean and nicely decorated houses. the scientific reason is that the monsoon is a time for insects and fungus to breed.with the end of the monsoon, homes need to be cleaned and painted, and belongings aired and dried before the onset of winter. the festival itself extends over about a week even though the most important day is the new moonday.  in east bihar and northern india, two days before diwali is celebrated as dhanteras in honour of dhanvantari, the physician of the gods. he is believed to have emerged with a pot of amrita during the samudra manthan. people bathe early in the morning and observe a fast, which is broken only after sunset with sweetmeats, puri and other delicacies. on dhanteras, new kitchen utensils are bought and kept at the place of worship. the buying of utensils, according to one theory, relates to the myth of dhanvantari emerging from the ocean with a pot in his hand. since he is also the physician of the gods, cleanliness and hygiene are essential to this festival. the day before diwali is celebratedas choti diwali or 'small diwali'. it is diwali on a smaller scale, with fewer lights lit and fewer crackers burst.  the morning after choti diwali, the women of the house make beautiful, coloured rangoli in the doorway and courtyard. tiny footprints made out of rice paste are a special feature of the rangolis made for diwali. they signify the footprints of lakshmi, as she enters the house. in hindu homes, diwali celebrations involve a ritual puja to lakshmi and also to rama in the evening. songs in honour of the gods are sung and arati is performed. oil or ghee diyas are also lit. the gods are offered kheel, batashe and khilone and various sweetmeats. after the puja, the diyas are placed in and around the house: in the doorway, near the tulasi plant, the backyard, every room and the back and front gates. after this, crackers are burst, and people meet friends and neighbours to exchange good wishes and sweets. since diwali falls on the new moon night, lamps are lit to brighten this moonless night. according to a myth, lakshmi will not enter a dark house. the lamps also welcome home the spirits of dead ancestors, who are believed to visit on this auspicious night. in addition, the light frightens away any evil spirit that might be wandering about near the house on this night. in orissa, lamps are lit to light up the dark path that the spirits of ancestors take back to heaven. in modern times, ghee diyas have been replaced by wax candles and coloured electric bulbs. in many areas, there is a competition of sorts among neighbours as everyone tries to have the brightest lights. the origin of diwali can be traced back to ancient india, when it was probably an important harvesting season. it was thus extremely important to the largely pastoral vaishya community. their granaries were full, and the weather was good, at the end of the long monsoon and before the arduous winter. it was therefore a good time to celebrate. the vaishya community began their new year with this happy occassion, after paying their debts and clearing their ledgers. as the religion developed, various mythological stories and explanations were attributedto this festival to give it religious sanction.  however today, this historical explanation is all but lost among the many stories and folklore linked with the origin of the festival. according to the most popular one, diwali is celebrated in honour of rama, his consort sita and brother lakshmana, returning to their kingdom ayodhya after a 14-year exile.to celebrate this event, people at ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps. the illuminations also symbolise the removal of spiritual darkness and the onset of happiness and prosperity.    according to another belief, it is on this day that lakshmi emerged from the ocean during the samudra manthan .lakshmi puja commemorates her birth and therefore forms a major part of diwali celebrations. being associated with the goddess of wealth and fortune, diwali is specially important to the vaishya   community. most tradesmen close their old ledgers and dealings and start afresh with new ledgers after diwali. this day, with its emphasis on money, is also considered lucky for gambling. giving social sanction to a vice, a popular saying states that one who does not gamble on this day will beborn a donkey in his next birth. casinos and local gambling houses do brisk business during the diwali week. in most homes, people invite their friends and relatives over to play cards.   another reason for the celebration of diwali is that it marks the killing of the evil narkasura at the hands of krishna naraka is believed to have abducted 16,000 women. krishna killed him and rescued these women whom he later married. naraka is the personification of hell and is believed to be the monsoon during which all activities come to a standstill.   though diwali is equally important in the south and the north, the celebrations are markedly different. in south india, the story widely associated with diwali is that of narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of vishnu. according to a legend, hiranyakshipu was an evil demon king. he was unjust and cruel to his people. however, he was almost invincible, having extracted a boon from brahma that he would be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night. when his atrocities became unbearable, the gods sought vishnu's help. assuming his fifth incarnation of narasimha, the man-lion,vishnu killed hiranyakshipu with his claws in the courtyard just before day break, hence steering clear of the boundaries of the boon. for this reason in the south, people light diyas in their houses on the day preceding diwali. the next day begins early. first is the ritual bath, which begins with an oil massage of the hair and body. this is absolutely essential on this day. its importance probably refers to cleaning oneself thoroughly after the monsoon months. after bathing, people receive new clothes and gifts from their elders, which they are expected to wear. the family then prays to vishnu for its well-being and prosperity. after the prayers start the main celebrations which, as in the north, consist of bursting crackers and lighting candles.at day break, all celebrations end.people then visit friends and relatives and exchange sweets.   references to the word 'atishbaji' or'crackers' are found even in ancient literature. the bursting of crackers is today the most important and eagerly-awaited part of the diwali celebrations. according to one belief, the sound that resounds throughout the universe makes all aware of the great homecoming of rama. another belief is that the crackers are an indication ofthe joy of the people living on the earth, making the gods aware of their plentiful state. still another possible reason has a more scientific basis: the fumes produced by the crackers kill a lot of insects, found in plenty after the rains. the use of high-tech bomb crackers is fairly recent. at times, diwali celebrations get ugly, especially in the metropolitan cities. in new delhi, people start bursting crackers in the evening and this continues till the early hours ofthe morning. as a result, the city is engulfed in toxic fumes and smoke for almost 10 hours. another problem with crackers is that their manufacture is usually unregulated. as a result, the manufacturing units are unsafe and the material used is inflammable and toxic.every year, many units are destroyed inaccidental fires, resulting in the death of those employed there.   kerala is probably the only state in india where even hindus do not celebrate diwali. the major festival there is onam. in west bengal, kali puja is performed on diwali as it is believed that on this day kali killed the wicked raktavija. being one of the main festivals of the trader community, markets are gaily decorated and lit up. many safety measures and precautions are telecast on television and radio, especially for children. the fire departments are kept on the alert, and the municipal corporations of bigger cities also organise buckets and tankers of water at strategic locations. the second day after diwali is celebrated as bhai duja when sisters apply tilak to their brothers and pray for their long and happy life. in all likelihood, this ritual was originally intended only for married women. since they celebrated diwali with their in-laws, this festival allowed them to come to their parents' home during this auspicious time. they got some time to meet the family and to rest after the hectic activity of the preceding week.and it gave their parents an opportunity to give them gifts, an opportunity they did not often get. nowadays however, among many communities bhai duja is observed by both married and unmarried sisters.   urllink http://webonautics.com/ethnicindia/festivals/diwali.html"

'i have to defend both my world-famous brand - the bible and its distinctive likenesses - and the livelihood of those who create and distribute legal copies of it. sure, they live not by bread alone, but website hits - someone else's website mind you - don't pay the bills for these folks.' since large portions of the bible are many centuries old, many people believe the work to be in the public domain. not so, said god. 'look, most copyright laws are based on something like the author's lifetime plus, let's say, 15 years. news flash: i'm still here.' ' i am a jealous god,' he said, 'but i am by no means unreasonable. if the person will stop distributing my copyrighted materials, there will be no further consequences. like i've said before: hate pirating, love the pirate.'

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"29,May,2000","the following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the university of copenhagen:



""describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer.""



one student replied:



""you tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. the length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.""



this highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately. the student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.



the arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics. to resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.



for five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. the arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use. on being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:



""firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. the height of the building can then be worked out from the formula h = 0.5g x t squared. but bad luck on the barometer.""



""or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.""



""but if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. the height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force t = 2 pi sqrroot (l / g).""



""or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.""



""if you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.""



""but since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'if you would like a nice new barometer, i will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'.""

""god created man in his own image"" is reverse logic.   man  created  god , especially in his own image.  heaven and hell are products of the human psyche being unable to comprehend unconciousness.  if the mind does not exist after death, how can we understand it?   since that is impossible (sarcasm), heaven and hell were created as a true after life .  the afterlife is just like the mortal existence, yet a dichotomy is created.  if you were good, heaven; bad, hell.  is this not a very ingenious way to keep control over people during their entire life?  then again, karma is almost the same pattern.  defining your next form through reincarntion based on karma; it's the same sort of control.  mankind has created religion as a way to answer that which cannot be answered.  along the way, it has been tailored such that it can control the masses.    studies on buddhism and hinduism were most appealing to me at a younger age.  except for the aforementioned problems inherent with the karma and caste systems, the religions seem more logical.  there is conservation of matter and conservation of energy, so the idea of conservation of soul (life force, spirit) makes perfect sense to my logical mind.  reincarnation, of some form, is the only conclusion to life that makes any sense.  not even my mind can grasp the idea that we just  die .  maybe i would enjoy life more knowing that."

mark: gerald, that's inadmissible and you know it! 



bruce: [realizes his error and gently closes the drawer.] the doobie brothers?? 



[pause] 



mark: all right, perhaps we were a little hasty with the 17-week dating commitment. perhaps we can accommodate the obvious interests of your client a bit more. how about this: a six date schedule with possible sexual intercourse on date six. 



bruce: gerald, i'm no longer interested in this ""possible sexual intercourse"" you keep selling me on. last time, it turned out to be a cheap handjob at the drive in. 



mark: your client ejaculated, gerald! 



bruce: sadly. very sadly. let's just let sleeping dogs lie, shall we? [pause] three date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on dates two and three. 



mark: uh uh. five date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on date five. now that's a one-way ticket to loveland, gerald. that's a heap of good lovin'. that's a love-o-rama. that's a love fest. that's a love woodstock, for god's sake. come back to me. 



[long pause. bruce has a goofy smile on his face, in thought.] 



bruce: gerald. [calling him in closer] gerry. [closer] ger. . .guh. why don't we forget the guaranteed sexual intercourse clause. 



mark: okay. 



bruce: why don't we let nature take it's course. 



mark: fine! 



bruce: you know the good old fashioned way? 



mark: [eagerly] yeah, okay. 



bruce: a one date schedule with a guarantee that your client will consume 27-ounces of gin on that evening. 



mark: come off it gerald! that's panty peeler and you know it. 



bruce: call it what you will, it's a tool of the trade. 



mark: sorry gerald. c'mon, she only weighs 105 pounds, for god's sake. 



bruce: i believe she weighs 111 pounds, gerald. 



mark: in shoes! [pause] all right. i can't see letting her drink more than 8-ounces of gin. 



bruce: jeez, i think she can drink, uh, 14-ounces of gin. 



mark: maybe 10, maybe 10. 



bruce: i think she could scarf down 12-ounces of gin. 



mark: 11-ounces of gin. 



bruce: 12-ounces of gin on an empty stomach. 



mark: 11 on an empty stomach. 



bruce: [taps his fingers on the desk, calculating in his head.] 111. . .done!

cast- 

scott- son

dave- mother



[bruce is singing his son to sleep.]



bruce: [singing] picnic time for teddy bears / those little teddy bears are having a wonderful time tonight.



[bruce tries to leave because scott appears to be asleep. as soon as bruce tries this, scott wakes up and looks to bruce as if he's not at all tired.]



bruce: [singing] see them gaily play about / they love to sing and shout.



[bruce tries to leave again, same thing happens.]



bruce: [singing] they haven't got any cares [gets up to leave but this time continues to sing] but it's six o' clock / their mummies and daddies will take them home to bed / because they're tired little teddy bears. [talking] good night. [flips light off.] 



scott: dad?



bruce: [light back on, still at doorway] uh, yes?



scott: were all the bears there?



bruce: yes. all the bears there ever there was were there. goodnight.



scott: dad? how--how come the picnic ended at six o' clock? if it was so good? i mean, it's--it's not even dark at six.



bruce: uh, all the bears were tired from, um..., frolicking.



scott: oh.



bruce: frolicking's very tiring, son. goodnight



scott: okay, what they--what they eat?



bruce: oh. well. the teddy bears ate buttons and...felt.



scott: ewww!



bruce: oh, no no! that's teddy bear food.



scott: oh.



bruce: it's like hot dogs. mmm. 



scott: okay, yeah. were you even there? what?



bruce: [bruce sees he is not about to leave, so he goes back to scott at the bed.] no, i wasn't actually there.



scott: well, then--then how do you know?



bruce: a guy at work told me.



scott: who?



bruce: hank.



scott: hank who?



bruce: you don't know him.



scott: maybe i should call this hank.



bruce: no no. i don't think that would be a good idea, son.



scott: why?



bruce: because he doesn't have a phone.



scott: what?! what kind of a freak doesn't have a phone?



bruce: a freak that works in the mailroom.



scott: ohh.



bruce: now go to sleep.



scott: dad, i can't sleep trying to piece together this sloppy narrative.



bruce: [sighs] why don't you try, uh, counting sheep?



scott: [cries/whines] ahh!!



bruce: what? what, guy?



scott: how can you make me think of all those slaughtered sheep bloated in the sun? [cries]



bruce: they're not slaughtered sheep, son. they're live ones bounding over your head.



scott: what? i thought they were dead! you didn't tell me they were alive. dad, i was up all night tagging their toes. [cries]



[dave enters]



dave: what is going on around here?



scott: [still crying] maa! uh uh!



[dave goes over to scott, who in turn clings onto dave's arm.]



dave: oh, oh. there, there. what is it?



scott: yeah, yeah. dad told me this ""teddy bears' picnic"" story and it sounds like utter bullshit to me.



dave: there, there. just remember that your father loves you and i love you even more. . .



scott: okay.



dave: . . . and if you ever use that kind of language in this house again, i'm gonna wash your mouth out with soup.



scott: oh.



bruce: uh, i think that's soap, dear.



dave: don't ever contradict me in front of the boy. there, there, little hero, you get some sleep. okay.



scott: okay, `night mom.



dave: `night.



bruce: `night, tiger.



[bruce approaches scott to give him a kiss, but scott puts his fists up in self-defense. bruce kisses the fists. bruce and dave leave, they turn out the light, and scott is alone.]



scott: bullshit. bullshit. bullshit. mmm, soup.



[cut to parents' bedroom.]



bruce: goodnight.



dave: so, this teddy bears' picnic story isn't true?



bruce: um, no. not exactly.



dave: well, if you weren't helping out at the picnic, where were you last weekend? hmm?



bruce: you think i'm having an affair, don't you?!



dave: [shocked] an affair?!! oh my god!



bruce: um, you didn't think that?



dave: [shakes his head no.]



bruce: oh. okay, i'm gonna be honest with you. i was out with a few of the guys from work. . .and a few goblins. . .and, uh, it started raining gumdrops. . .so uh. . .we happened into this wizard's tavern, and uh. . .i'm gonna be honest, we had a little too much dew to drink. so, uh. . .i thought i shouldn't drive.



dave: well, you did the right thing by not driving, but you should have called.



bruce: well, you know, it's the darndest thing, honey, um, the wizard's leaf wouldn't dial out.



dave: well, fine. but next time you should just try harder to get a hold of me.



bruce: you're right, sweetie.



dave: alright.



bruce: goodnight. [turns out the nightstand's light.]



dave: who's doris?



bruce: [turns light back on. frantically:] doris. doris, doris, uh, doris.



dave: doris. a woman named doris came to the house the other day and said she'd been meeting you for some time in sleazy motel rooms and that she was carrying your child and wanted to know what you were going to do about it, and i was just wonder who she was.



bruce: uh, i could see why you'd be curious.



dave: yes, well she did pique my interest, yes.



bruce: honey? she's a goat. she's a magical goat. and, she delights on playing tricks on us mere mortals.



dave: i am so. . .relieved!



[bruce also relieved. both laugh.]



dave: i feel like such an idiot.



bruce: don't feel like an idiot. no no, it's natural.



dave: oh, can you forgive me?



bruce: i do, i do.



dave: oh, i should be jealous. [cuddles into covers]



bruce: [turns out light] yes you should."

so i'm waiting for the bus at cc little to go to north campus, and this girl walks up and stands next to me.  she's hot, by the way, and she's wearing a tri-delt sweatshirt.  after i was done thinking about how hot she was, i realize that she's an idiot because i'm wearing my winter fucking coat and am still cold and she's standing outside waiting for a bus in nothing more than a sweatshirt.  well, i've probably never been more right about anything in my life.



so right when the bus is coming up she sees one of her friends - had to be in a sorority if not tridelt due to the black fuck me pants, black down north face jacket, black wool hat and black framed glasses.  she also had black sandals on - yes, it was still cold outside.



as i get on the bus, they sit down in front of me, which was nice, because remember, they're both hot.  i'm not really paying attention to anything in particular, mostly because i'm contemplating how much it sucks that i'm going to north campus to sit in a class that i don't really need to be going to anyway, and so it catches me off guard a bit when i realize what the two girls in front of me are talking about.  hard boiled eggs.  it was just weird, that's all.



so anyway, i'm listening to the girl in black bitch about how her roommate will hard boil all of the eggs in the fridge to use on salads at once, and then keep them in the egg carton so that when she wants to use an egg (god only know for what purpose - it certainly wasn't to eat, unless she was planning on inducing vomiting afterwards) she cracks it open only to find that it's hard boiled and not a raw egg. well this is where it starts to get entertaining for all of the engineers on the bus.  now, it was just about 1 o'clock when i was on the bus, so there were a lot of non-engineering students just headed back to bursley after class, and thus only about half the bus was keeping an eye on the hot chicks - you see, engineers don't come across girls much, and when we encounter hot chicks we tend to just kind of stare at them.  well, anyway, remember the girl in black was talking about all of the hard boiled eggs.



so, the girl in the sweatshirt says, rather loudly, ""well, why don't you just unboil them?""



now, remember we on the bus that are paying attention are all engineers. i had already figured out that this girl was an idiot (sweatshirt in the cold), but the rest of the engineers must have been too engrossed staring at her to think much of that, so when she says the line about unboiling the eggs, one engineer just about chokes on his jimmy john's while the others stares turn from awe to amazement and shock at her stupidity - it really was funny.



so the girl in black actually notices everyone staring at them at this point, and gets a little bit freaked out.  she says something like, ""what the fuck are you talking about, you can't unboil an egg"", to which dumb sweatshirt girl says, sure you can, my boyfriend told me all about it.



and i'll spare you the story, but it basically involved a practical joke that her boyfriend had played on her which resulted in her cracking a raw egg on her forehead.  by now, most of the people on the bus, even the non-engineers, are trying to contain their laughter.  i really can't, and i'm pretty much laughing out loud, but only the girl in black notices.



and she gets pissed - either at the sweatshirt girl, or at everyone laughing at her, i don't know - and starts yelling, ""you cant unboil an egg"".  each time she yells it, sweatshirt girl starts getting bitchier and bitchier, yelling ""yes you can"".  finally, the dude in front of them turns around, looks sweatshirt girl in the eye and says ""you're crazy, you can't unboil an egg"". this shut her up at least, and the north face girl looks really happy at being validated - i think that during the whole argument she wasn't really sure herself that you couldn't unboil an egg.



so the sweatshirt girl just sits there for a minute, and then i can hear her mumbling under her breath something about ""chemicals"" and ""her boyfriend"" and she finally tells the northface girl that ""i'm sure you can somehow.""



northface girl of course just yells ""no you cant"".



by now, most of the engineers have slapped their foreheads and left their hands there, making a pretty funny scene - a whole bunch of dorky guys holding their hands to their heads while shaking them.



the girls talked about it for a while, and finally sweatshirt girl agreed that maybe you couldn't unboil an egg.  by now, the rest of the bus was talking about it, and from the front, we could all hear a flaming homosexual music major ask, in the loudest, gayest voice possible, ""well, why *couldn't* you unboil an egg"", which caused me and just about everyone else to go into convulsions of laughter all over again.



by now, we had just about reached the stop, but stupid sweatshirt girl wasn't done yet.  she had started talking about how it was tuesday, and tomorrow was wednesday, and how we should change the calendar so that wednesday was the first day in the week and tuesday was the last, so that we would have the weekend in the middle of the week.



one of the engineers to our right had had enough i guess, and interrupted the two girls to inform them that if you put the weekend in the middle of the week, it would no longer be a weekend, it would be a weekmiddle.



neither girl understood it, and while he tried to explain for a bit, we all ended up getting off the bus before he had a chance to finish."

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"25,March,2002","two months ago, i would never have thought that a significant portion of my computing time would involve linux.         this semester, i am in eecs 481, software engineering.  i would give you a link to the class homepage, but the professor decided the content isn't for the common man -- it's password protected.  the core of this class is a single, monolithic (redundant repetition, i know) project.  the only constrain to this project is that it must concern a certain  domain .  the domain for this semester is the software process.  how self-referential is that?  our software project must be about the software process.   

        we decided on a project manager with some automatic environment creation scripts.  basically, the manager of a software company would use a windows front end to manage his developers.  he could see what projects they are working on, what experience they have, etc etc.  whenever he had a new project, he could select which developers should work on it and click a single button to setup a few necessities:  a web site, mailing list and cvs repository for the new project.  

        we needed a server-class operating system for the backend.  though i know  urllink openbsd  fairly well (going on 2 years admin experience), we chose  urllink redhat  7.2.  the decision was made simply because of the greater install base of redhat.

        when i first started developing the backend scripts (i did it since no one else had the experience to correctly setup majordomo and apache, let alone know how to write perl scripts), i used vmware on my main machine.  vmware made my life much easier as i tested these scripts.  before i would do a new install of the scripts, i would backup my entire redhat machine with two clicks.  if the install went haywire (which it often did), restoration was as simple.  

        enter my new laptop: a used ibm thinkpad 600.  ever since i got this thing, i have taken it to every class and worked on code while the professors droned on and on.  i got the idea of working on the scripts while in class.  redhat 7.2 installed beautifully.  slowly but surely, my windows xp partition is touched less and less.  the laptop boots into linux by default.  

        linux  and open source software has improved dramatically since i last used it (redhat 6.2 days).  abiword reads most word files cleanly (other than tables, bleh!),  urllink mozilla  0.9.9 is now my default browser everywhere (the macs at work, my windows xp machines, this laptop), and i just found a new love:   urllink ximian red carpet .  think  urllink windows update  on steroids.  i will be trying  urllink ximian desktop  next.

        expect more reports on my new love."

* chirako gags 

<chirako> if there's one thing dogs love, it's rich, 

<chirako> beefy gravy. that's why every nugget of 

<chirako> gravy train is basted in real beef juices. 

<chirako> just mix it with warm water, and you can 

<chirako> give your dog a warm homestyle meal, 

<chirako> dripping with the delicious gravy he loves.

<stank> and i stood uncomfortably on a porch with a bunch of people i don't know. 

<stank> but then i ran into bill and will, who were pretending in the same way. 

<stank> so we talked about networks and i felt better. 

 

<dane-lo_brown[djedi]> i got in trouble in school cause my espanol teacher asked what architecture we learned from the latinos and i said cardboard boxes 

<paradox> so, guys, i have some news. 

<paradox> i know i usually don't talk much about stuff unless it's solid, but this is interesting, and i think you should know. 

<paradox> i just got an e-mail about an interesting proposition.  * volsung_ perks up. 

<paradox> apparently, there are lesbians that want my 'hard cock.' 

* volsung_ flips paradox the bird. 

<volsung_> :) 

<paradox> they want it 'now,' apparently, so the timetable is somewhat limited. 

<volsung_> are you going to just take their offer as presented, or is there an opportunity for negotiation? 

<paradox> i'm not sure. 

<volsung_> i'm sure your hard cock is in great demand.  an exclusive deal might not be in your best interest. 

<paradox> last time i got an offer like this, there were some catches.

(it reminded me of a  urllink mandelbrot set , now that i think of it.  do you dream in fractals?  thought not.)  the owner of the mansion and (what could only be) his young daughter showed me to a room.  they said there was only one problem, the bed had been in the pond earlier.  eh, whatever, i took the room anyway.    

i fell asleep (in the dream) and woke up with two leech-like beings on my left hand.  i immediately started to swat at them, trying to get them off.  the owner and daughter (who must have been watching me sleep) yelled at me to stop and that these leeches would keep sucking until either they filled with blood or died.  on closer inspection, the leeches had these coiled bodies that could expand and hold a lot of blood.  i had to get to the hospital, so i called eric (who knows why he was in georgia).  he picked me up in some weird dodge neon-suv hybrid (which can be explained by the fact that i fell asleep reading motor trend) and we tried to ask for directions to the nearest hospital.  everyone would give us directions, but different directions.  just as we got on the highway, i woke up.  my entire left arm was completely asleep which explains the leech bit."

basically, joe tossed gt3 into the ps2 earlier this week for the first time since we've owned it.  he has only played the rally races (since he hates all of the races on pavement).  matt and him scrapped for awhile and i tossed my hat into the ring.  i was under the impression that to correctly navigate a turn you had to be turning the whole time.  in rally, this couldn't be farther from the truth.  you turn well before the actual bend in the road and then power slide through almost every one.  i got smoked in those first few races.  after they had left, i gave the course a few more runs.  i just barely beat the course on ""easy"" mode *then* i figured out turning.  each run saw my times improving after each iteration.  eventually, i was beating the cpu car by 10 seconds in ""hard"" mode.  that is when i got hooked.  

gt3 is an extremely deep game.  even the simplistic ""arcade"" mode has 30+ tracks and too many cars for me to count.  the simulation mode has a depth i haven't quite fathomed yet.  you start off with a meager amount of money and no cars.  my first car had a whopping 116 hp to start, which was pretty depressing since zig had a car that was pushing 1048 hp.  you can customize your car, earn driving licenses (that allow you to enter the more difficult races), and obviously race.  i've just started, but i'm sure i am going to be hooked.  

on to chess.  for some reason, zig decided that all of his programming buddies should have a contest.  he will write a basic gui that allows people to plug-in two chess engines and have them go at it.  i doubt i will participate (since writing a chess engine would take hundreds of hours, at least), but that got chess on our minds.  after dinner (a tuesday night tradition with the guys), chris and i ran to the chess store at briarwood and picked up a chess clock.  we went back to my apartment and played four games:  chris versus matt, matt versus joe, joe versus myself and then joe versus chris.  none of the games ended with a checkmate since we were playing with the clock.  the first game gave 15 minutes per person then we pulled that down to 10 minutes per game when joe was playing.  i just didn't pay attention to the clock and i ran out of time with the game probably only half way through.  speed chess just isn't my thing, but i at least didn't lose in less than 20 minutes total.  

hopefully i stick with both of these games."

anger 

1.  who did you last get angry with?   i guess i would have to say chris payne.  he was acting very out of character last saturday night. 

2.  what is your weapon of choice?   first choice is words, second choice is the fist. 

3.  would you hit a member of the opposite sex?   under 99.99% of circumstances, never.  the only reason i would ever hit a female would be to protect someone.  in all reality, i would probalby just hold them back if possible. 

4.  how about of the same sex?   of course i would rail on a dude.  dudes are made to be hit. 

5.  who was the last person who got really angry at you?   jamie.  kids say the darndest things. 

6.  what is your pet peeve?   when people bite their fork.  it sounds like nails on a chalkboard and it seems so trashy. 

7.  do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily?   it depends on who it is against.  if it is with someone i am close to, it is usually quickly resolved.  against someone i do not know well or do not like, it can last indefinitely.  



sloth 

1.  what is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time?   use my teeth whitener.  all those years of drinking nothing but coffee and diet coke did a number on them. 

2.  what is the latest you've ever woken up?   5 pm.  i once pulled an all nighter and ended up going to bed around noon. 

3.  name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't?  hmm, my maternal grandmother.  

4.  what is the last lame excuse you made?   not really an excuse, but just tonight megan and i were at borders.  there was a book called  why paint cats  (yes, it's as weird as it sounds).  she actually bought a book called  why cats paint  for her dad, so i said that this must be a sequel thus she must buy it. 

5.  have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through (one of the long ones...)?    never.  i don't watch tv, other than  urllink 24 . 

6.  how many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today?   i didn't.  i don't need an alarm clock anymore.  when i quit drinking caffeine, my sleep requirements went from 8.5 hours a night to just about 5 hours a night. 

7.   how many times have you skipped work/classes this month?   since i have a completely flexible work schedule, i cannot techincally skip work.  i think i've skipped two classes total.  



gluttony 

1.  what is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice?   sobe green tea...   drool... 

2.  meat eaters: white meat or dark meat?   white meat. 

3.  what is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event?   probably about 14 drinks in a single evening. 

4.  what's the most you've ever weighed?  188, the weight i am at now.  ever since i started working out almost every day, i've gained about 10 pounds.  hopefully i've actually lost some fat and gained more than 10 pounds in muscle. 

5.  what have you eaten so far today?   breakfast was a bowl of cereal, a bagel and a can of mixed fruit.  lunch was a veggie sub from jimmy john's.  afternoon snack was crackers with peanut butter and jelly.  dinner was another sub, this time a ham one from potbelly.  i am sure i will eat the equivalent of another meal before i go to bed.  working out has dramatically increased my metabolism. 

6.  when was the last time you ate so much you felt sick?   the last time i got two subs from jimmy john's after working out.  my stomach couldn't handle it, but my body was craving nutrients. 

7.  when was the last time you got drunk to the point of throwing up?   that time i had 14 drinks in an evening.  playing poker with the guys and going shot for shot isn't a good call.  



lust 

1.  how many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)?   3 plus naked mile plus however many people were on the wrestling and football teams in high school 

2.  how many people have seen you naked (not counting physicians/family)?  3 plus the teams 

3.  have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation?   yes. 

4.  have you ""done it""?    yes. 

5.  what is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice?   eyes. 

6.  have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute?   no. 

7.  have you ever had to get tested for an std or pregnancy?   no.  



greed 

1.  how many credit cards do you own?   i personally have 2 in my name and then there is a card that is a joint account of myself and my aunt and a debit card. 

2.  what's your guilty pleasure store?   i guess j. crew. 

3. i f you had $1 million, what would you do with it?   i would move out of my crappy apartment, buy a few  urllink cars  and try to invest the rest. 

4.  would you rather be rich, or famous?   rich.  being famous is pointless. 

5.  would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks?   aren't all jobs inherently boring to some degree? 

6.  have you ever stolen anything?    yes.  i vividly remember taking vaseline lip balm when i was 6. 

7.  how many mp3s are on your hard drive?   currently, 3,898.  



pride 

1.  what one thing have you done that you're most proud of?   i am not really proud of anything yet.  i will find pride when i have a happy, stable family. 

2.  what one thing have you done that your parents are most proud of?   anything academic.  they've been proud of me so far in all aspects though. 

3.  what thing would you like to accomplish in your life?   other than the happy, stable family, i would like to make some lasting contribution to whatever field i end up working in. 

4.  do you get annoyed by coming in second place?   of course!  i am more competitive than almost anyone i know. 

5.  have you ever entered a contest of skill, knowing you were of much higher skill than all the other competitors?   again, of course.  it's so easy to crush people that way, and crushing makes me feel whole. 

6.  have you ever cheated on something to get a higher score?   of course. 

7.  what did you do today that you're proud of?   i set a new max on my bench press.  i'm only at 250 pounds though.  



envy 

1.  what item (or person) of your friends would you most want to have for your own?   currently, zig's car would be nice.  i want something faster though. 

2.  who would you want to go on ""trading spaces"" with?   kristin happ, since she is the only person i know that watches that show more than my parents. 

3.  if you could be anyone else in the world, who would you be?   no one. 

4.  have you ever been cheated on?   actually, i don't know.  i may have been cheated on with two different girls, but i have no proof. 

5.  have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own?   yes, i wish my skin was clearer and i was less hairy. 

6.  what inborn trait do you see in others that you wish you had for yourself?   complete confidence."
24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"24,March,2003","today while i was working out at the ccrb, a girl actually hit on me.  this has happened maybe three times in my entire life.  here are the details:  the wrestling mats were laid out in the martial arts room because a session of aikido had just concluded.  i had just finished my cardio and lifting and was walking around a bit to cool down.  when i saw the mats, i decided to do some of my wrestling rolls just as a cool down.  i started off walking on my hands because that was the most fun and was the most strenuous.  a girl that was stretching at the end of the room started watching me.  i ignored it, since she was just watching because who walks on their hands?  thirty seconds later, she came up to me and asked if she could join me.  at this point, i was a bit confused.  i hadn't been hit on in a very long time so i didn't know what to do and i also have a very serious girlfriend.  i didn't want to blow this girl off just for the sake of being rude, but i couldn't lead her on in any way.  anyway, i said of course she could join me and she asked if i did gymnastics.  i explained that i used to walk on my hands when i wrestled in high school.  she asked if i wrestled for michigan and i just laughed.  we introduced ourselves and she then said that she does hand stands because she used to do gymnastics in school and that now she likes to breakdance.  she started to show off by walking on her hands and then doing single handed dismounts.  at this point, i either had to commit or bail.  instead of committing by asking about her dancing, i simply said that i had to get going.  she laughed out of obvious nervousness, probably because she didn't want me to leave.  i simply grabbed my water bottle and headphones and ended that encounter."

friday was the  urllink compulsive lyres  concert.  i hadn't been to an a cappella concert in quite some time, even though i went often in my first few years here.  the lyres put on a great performance, as did the  urllink friars  and the  urllink maine steiners .  not so great was the indigo dance team.  after being introduced, they were late getting on stage, couldn't find their places, had to reorganized everything on stage and then the music problems kicked in.  first, there was a boom box on stage that was used as a prop by the lyres.  for some reason, the dance team thought their music was going to be played on said boom box.  first they couldn't figure out how to turn it on, then they noticed that there was no cd in it.  they looked around confused, got into their dance positions just as their music started  blaring  over the auditorium speakers.  this was just the beginnings of their problems.  two of the girls just could not stay in sync which threw everyone off.  though there were many little kids in the audience, most of their music was about sex and filled with swearing.  needless to say, even though they were scheduled to dance during two portions of the show, they didn't return.  after the show was the lyres after party at colonial lanes.  it was a rock 'n bowl night, which actually turned out to be quite fun.  jamie, alissa, bri and i bowled a couple of games and none of us broke 100.  somehow, jamie found a way to bowl that required her to clench her left butt cheek for balance.  her butt was sore for days afterward.  we all had fun while bowling, but things got a bit tense early in the morning.  saturday, chris and i hung out for most of the day.  his back is pretty messed up, so we went to the doctors first.  the rest of the day was spent playing video games (tekken 4 and nwn).  that night, jamie, zig, eric, matt, kristin and i went to charlie's and then back to jamie's place.  things got a bit crazy at jamie's since i ended up putting crisco in zig's mouth at one point.  i thought it was maybe 1 am when i finally went to bed but jamie informed me later that it was closer to 5 am.  whoops.  anyway,  urllink here  are the pictures from that night."

let's just say that was a horrible idea.  i started to get pretty wired an hour in, but i figured that would be the only symptom.  i was so wrong.  my concentration started to wane, i was getting dizzy and then it got worse.  eventually, i just wanted to either run around the room or puke.  i had to dry heave for a good five minutes until i could stand up again.  i got probably a good half an hour of work done between midnight and 3:30 am when i finally fell asleep."

a lot of things are going to be different when i graduate.  there are many little advantages i take for granted, like student pricing on tickets and all of the computing access i get from the university.  i need to figure out what i'm going to do for a primary email address!  i will probably move over to something like mike@bibik.org soon.  but where should i host it?  i don't want to pay for hosting, i am leaving the daily soon so i can't use their servers and my home server doesn't have a static ip.  oh well, that might be the least of my worries.

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"10,May,2003","let's see, where to begin...  first, the interview from a week and a half ago!  i can't divulge much information, for two reasons:  1)  i haven't gotten a yes or a no from said company.  2)  i had to sign an nda before i could talk to anyone.  let's see how many details i can give away without giving it all away.  

first, i was told that i would have anywhere between three and five interviews total.  there ended up being a total of six, which i can only interpret as being a hopeful sign.  i arrived at the recruiting building (yes, an entire building devoted to recruiting) around 8 am and didn't end up leaving until around 6 pm.  given a half hour for lunch, that was practically nine and a half hours of interviewing!  

second, the riddles asked were fairly interesting and though i might have heard them all before, i had never solved any of them.  the first one wasn't so much a riddle as a generic design question.  i was asked how i would design the timing on any given traffic light.  i was allowed to request whatever information desired and then i had to come up with some formulas for making the ""best"" traffic light.  the first part of the problem was how to define ""best"".  what makes a good traffic light?  i decided it was a combination of two factors:  1)  maximum throughput in all directions.  2)  low traffic jam incidence rate.  after figuring out the formula for a single intersection, i had to modify it for a grid of intersections.  then i was asked to ""think outside the box"" (yes, that phrase was used exactly) and figure out other ways to improve the experience.  all in all, a basic design problem.  

the second riddle was a programming question, something i didn't expect to encounter since i was interviewing for a management position.  managers don't code!  i was given a 2d array and had to figure out the time it would take to sort it.  i barely remembered performance numbers for the different sort algorithms, but i remembered that quick sort was o(n log n) (and thankfully was correct).  sorting a 2d array would thus take (o(n log n))^2.  the second part to the programming question was how to sort two already sorted linked lists.  this was simple, since you just setup two iterators that would move along the two lists, removing the smaller of the two items.  

the riddle i had the hardest time with was the cube desk calendar.  you have two cubes and you are allowed to put any single digit on any face.  with these two cubes, you have to represent every number from 01 to 31.  this turned out to not be that difficult when i realized you could mathematically approach this and define restrictions.  some examples of these restrictions are that you need a ""1"" on each block since you have to represent ""11"".  the same thing for ""2"" and ""22"".  eventually, i got to the point where i had six open spots on the cubes but seven numbers to put on the cubes.  this is when i realized that you could use ""6"" to represent a ""9"" and thus solved the puzzle.  

almost all of the riddle had a mathematic basis.  the next riddle started off as a word problem.  a man starts at point a on a mountain and walks up to point b in exactly 12 hours.  at some time later, he walks down from point b to point a in exactly 12 hours.  he does not have a constant rate of ascent or descent.  the actual riddle was ""can you prove or disprove the existence of a point p where the man took the same amount of time to reach the same spot on the mountain?""  i was having trouble trying to prove this, since it had to be true.  eventually, i was given a hint to use a graph.  first i tried plotting time versus distance.  that was dumb.  once i plotted time versus location, i showed that the plots must intersect and thus a point p does exist.  

the last riddle was one i heard a long, long time ago.  i knew the answer, but didn't know how to explain it at first.  this was the ""let's make a deal"" riddle:  you have three doors to choose from, 1 with a prize and 2 without.  after you choose your door, the host of the show will eliminate one of the doors you did not choose and then ask you to pick again.  you can either stick with your original door or choose the remaining door.  the question is, do you stay or do you switch and why?  i knew you were supposed to switch, but couldn't think off the top of my head why.  finally i realized that your initial chance at winning was only 1 in 3.  after the elimination, your chance is at least 2 in 3.  switching is smart.  

ok, that was the first of more updates.  i gotta run now though."

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"24,June,2003","mmm mmm, nothing like a good one month hiatus to get the not-so-creative juices flowing.  where to start...  

well, obviously, i started working at microsoft!  the move out was emotional, if not uneventful.  the flight went fine, i got my month-long rental car just fine and i got into my new (temporary) apartment just fine.  jenn so gratiously gave me a gamecube just before i left.  that worked out perfectly because all of my stuff had already been packed to be shipped to the seattle area so i had to take the gc on the plane.  if it wasn't for the tv and the gc, i probably would have died of boredom those first four days.  imagine being in apartment without 99% of your belongings in a new city where you don't know anyone.  it was worse than i can describe.  yeah, i cried off and on those first few days.  there are so many people back in the se-mi area that i miss!  

once i got through those first few days, life improved.  i got into a routine of waking up early and going to bed early to prepare myself for work.  i drove around town getting myself used to the area.  one big thing i've noticed is the marked difference in driving patterns.  five over the speed limit is the most i've seen someone without a radar detector do.  most people drive slower than the speed limit!  this could be because everyone is used to the traffic...   i swear to god it has to be some of the worst in the us.  the area is surrounded by water and mountains so the highways are not as plentiful as possible.  it's also difficult to widen any of the existing highways.  there are simply too many people and cars for the area.  they do have hov (carpool) lanes, but it seems that very few people can take advantage of them.  i think i might start carpooling just because no one else is.  some of the on-ramps are metered (meaning that there is a light that will allow only one car through every few seconds) but allow open access to the hov lane.  i've also decided to change my car choice because of the traffic.  what's the fun in a  urllink sports car  if you can't take advantage of it?  it's also possible that i will have a substantial commute, so gas mileage might be a big concern.  i also haven't chosen a city to live in, let alone an apartment.  lots to do in the next couple of weeks!  

as for the job itself, i'm really not sure how much i can say.  i have a much better understanding of what i will actually be doing though!  from what i can tell, i will be a bug wrangler.  basically, i will help the developers and testers eliminate bugs from already-released products.  hotfix, updates, service packs, stuff like that.  also, my title has changed in the past two weeks: program manager on the critical response team in the mobile devices product group.  they changed from mdd (mobile devices division) to mdpg (mobile devices product group).  i was told this is a common occurance and not to stock up on business cards since they will be out of date before i get them.  i can't tell anyone my phone number or office number since they are supposed to change in the next two weeks.  the entire group (mdpg) is being shuffled around to better coordinate the smaller groups (like crt).  

if there is one thing i don't like about the job (yeah, already!) is that there are no set hours.  basically, if you are in the office in time for meetings and you get all of your work done, you can work whatever hours you want.  because of this, everyone has the mentality that they need to work 12 hours a day to look productive!  the first day (monday), i simply told my boss that i was leaving when i had finished all of my day-one work.  he said that was okay.  today (the second day), i ended up staying for 11 hours.  i got in around 7:30 am, which is about 2.5 hours before most of the office gets in.  when 4:30 pm rolled around, i didn't think it would look right to leave.  the office was still packed!  i need to go to a car dealership tomorrow around 5 pm and the dealership is 30 minutes away.  i'm going to have to leave before 4:30 pm.  i don't care what it looks like, i'm working hard.  i was given a simple to-do list for the next two days and i've already finished it.  i'm doing well, so far!  

anyway, that is all i have time for right now.  i still don't have my company-issued laptop and my two computers from home haven't shipped yet, so i have resorted to checking my umich mail from the local library.  hopefully this all gets rectified soon.  i miss you all!"

we cooked and chatted for a few hours, then decided to go to downtown seattle for fireworks.  russ and i took his car and ben and lee took lee's car.  let's just say that it was a case of the blind leading the blind.  once we found where we were supposed to be, the traffic was unbareable.  it took us at least an hour to find parking, then another 30 minutes to walk to the park.  we met up with some other people just in time for some snacks and then the fireworks started!  the show wasn't terribly eventful; the livonia fireworks were almost as good.  afterward, most of the group was going to bars down in pioneer square.  our group dwindled down to lee, ben, myself and a guy named matt.  neither matt nor ben wanted to go to the bar and lee and myself are fairly laid back, so we succumbed to their will.  instead of the bars, we went to 7-11 for slurpees then to krispy kreme for 18 donuts.  pretty lame, but it was actually pretty fun.  

that's a bit more than a typical night with the guys, but we are hanging out quite often.  they are a fun bunch, and this is really helping me adjust to the seattle area.  i will never forget the people back in the ann arbor - livonia area yet i'm glad i've met some people out here."

it flips slowly and at just the right angle so that when i plow into it, it is like hitting a wall.  most of the board shatters into hundreds of car-scratching pieces but one 1.5'x1.5' chunk sticks to my bumper since i'm driving 60 mph.  i pull off to the shoulder, slow down, the piece slides down and i run it over (possibly causing unseen tire damage).  

i just called the insurance agent and thankfully it will be covered.  unfortunately, the adjuster is booked until next saturday and i will have to pay my $250 comprensible deductible.  oh well, i'm not that upset.  if i had bought a sports car, i would have been a bit peeved.

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"02,September,2003","so, the trip to new york city   my first time, actually.  ive been to a few large metropolises before:  detroit, san francisco, atlanta, boston, seattle, orlando and toronto to name them all.  nyc is completely different from all of them and it starts with the ambiance.    

starting out in times square had to affect my perception dramatically, though.  the overall feeling that spewed from the city wasnt the common perception of impatience, snobbery or discourteousness, but one of surging energy.  as leah said, there is just so much to the city given that there are so many different sectors, each with its own life force.   time square was bursting with this power because of the sheer vivacity (tactless extravagance) and curiosity (aimless tourists).    

we also visited the rest of midtown, much of the upper east and west sides, downtown and even touched some of the nyu campus.  blast to the fact that i didnt have my camera that night:  there is a cube almost identical to the one on the umich campus!  the only difference is that theirs didnt spin.  as leah and i noticed it and walked near, someone hopped out of the car at a red light.  he scampered over the cube and tried to give it a push.  he hopped back into his car and then gestured to his passenger that he knew of a cube that rotated.  i yelled to him the one in ann arbor spins, eh? and he looked back, slightly bewildered and replied in the affirmative.  

since leah had just turned twenty one the previous week, we hit a few bars during the trip.  she had received a few suggestions from coworkers and with the power of pocket streets on my pocket pc, we hunted them down.  first problem:  one of the bars was called bowery.  when i pulled a find place, it found bowery alright.  it wasnt until we were in the heart of chinatown with no one around that i realized that it found a street called bowery and had simply shown me the centermost location on that street.  we used the pocket pc to locate the nearest bar she had been recommended, headed in that direction, but ended up going to the closest bar we saw.  it was called pioneer and wasnt too bad of a place.    

it was only 11:30 pm and while the bars in ann arbor or seattle would be full at that time, nyc bars are open until 4 am and dont seem to swell until 1:30 am.  there were about 25-35 people inside total, but you couldnt tell by the noise level.  the dj was blaring a mix of old and new dance (pop mostly) though no one was dancing and everyone had to yell over the music to hear each other.  nonetheless, we had fun.  a few (expensive) drinks later, our tongues were looser and we both learned something.  though i paid $7 for a shot, that wasnt anywhere near as bad as $26 for a woo woo (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) and a cosmopolitan when we saw cabaret!  

cabaret was the first show we saw, but it did pale in comparison to long days journey into the night.  jon secada as the mc?  he can sing, but he cannot dance or act.  the actress that played sally (melinda karakaredes (sp?)) did more than an admirable job.  i had seen the 1972 version of cabaret with liza minelli, but i do believe that i fell asleep through part of it.  i could follow the story well since i had seen the movie, even if i couldnt understand some of the lyrics of some of the songs.  

long days journey into the night was our first idea for the trip.  it was closing weekend, leah had heard nothing but good reviews and it had brian dennehey *and* philip seymour hoffman!  even though those seem like bigger names to me, it was vanessa redgrave that stole the show.  she had a much more difficult role to play and she absolutely sold it.  it was a character piece, and thus i was a huge fan.  hoffmans role seemed small and insignificant at first, but then the final scene changed all of that.  read the book or watch the movie to see what i mean.  

the three museums we hit (met, whitney and guggenheim) simply reinforced my ideas about art.  if it does not show technical ability or is not visually appealing (very subjective), then its worthless.  i still dislike watercolors and most modern art, still like primary colors, pale orange and brown against white and silver, mondrian and rotko, meiji period japanese art, geometric abstraction and period fusion (example:  an series of wwii-style japanese bombers in the shape of an infinity symbol over a burning current-day mid manhattan done in the style of edo period japanese room screens using mother-of-pearl inlay and gold).  i probably spent more time in museums in the past four days than i have in the past 10 years combined.  no complaints.  

well, thats it.  pictures to come."

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"06,October,2003","alright  urllink lindsay , let's see if i can match your dream posts.  

the first dream i had was more of a nightmare.  basically, two shady guys were going door to door trying to sell smartphones to people.  they had about 40 of the phones just tossed into a big plastic box.  i don't remember actually letting them into the house, but all of a sudden they were both in my parents kitchen trying to sell us ar11s.  as a side note, the  urllink ar11  is our most hated device.  it would never see a retail market because it has so many problems.  

 anyway, at first they were lackadaisically trying to get us to each buy a phone.  it seemed that they were both very tired, worn out and just wanted money.  it also seemed as if all the phones were stolen, obviously.  when we refused to buy a phone, they started to argue and yell at us.  eventually, i took things into my own hands and started to beat on the leader of the two guys.  i didn't hurt him too much and suddenly he was gone.  i shoved his companion out the door and he rested against a parked car.     

now this is where it starts to get weird and will be hard to imagine.  so picture that you are looking out the door of a house onto a driveway.  from your vantage point, you can see just the backend of a car parked in the driveway.  the second bad guy that i tossed out of the house was leaning against the car, facing the door.  he wasn't looking directly at me, but basically looking at the ground.  he seemed exhausted and looked to be resting a bit before moving on.   suddenly and without warning, you see just a glimpse of the first shady guy come into the picture as he drops an axe down on the skull of the second guy, practically cleaving it in two!  for some reason, i busted out of the house and ran past both the man wielding the axe and his now-dead accomplice.  i felt that i was being chased a bit and then i felt everything had changed.  i looked around, and the man with the axe was now laying on his back on the hood of a different car.  his axe seemed to have bashed him directly in the face.   i focused past that and saw my mom's friend evelyn holding a smoking gun!  i can only assume that while he was chasing me, she shot him in the back, he fell back onto the car and then his axe fell onto his face.  i woke up after that one.  

the second dream is fairly hazy, but i know some details.  the scene was the last day of class in presumably high school.  it was more like a boarding school because not only did we have to clean out our desks and say goodbye to students and teachers but we had to pack up our bedding and clothes as well.  i'm sure this has something to do with me reading so much harry potter lately.  i know there was some crying and there was a dark haired female teacher that we were all sad to say goodbye to.  the next thing i know, i'm getting married!  i don't remember much of the details, but it seems that in the dream i had a wedding and got married to jamie, then we divorced, then i was getting married to someone else not a month later.  weird."
24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"05,October,2003","ok, let's play with some numbers.  here are the current  urllink wrc  standings:

(55 pts) sebastien loeb 

(53 pts) carlos sainz 

(48 pts) petter solberg 

(43 pts) markko martin 

(38 pts) marcus gronholm  



burns is on a downward slope.  if his performance in italy is any indication of his desire to win the championship, we can all but write him off.  expect burns to score maybe 8 more points over the last three rallies.  loeb is hot now, but he is also inexperienced.  his car is sick, so if he can avoid a major retirement in britain he is going to pull down at least 15 more points.  sainz is too experienced to drop out of this championship without a fight.  he won't partake in any major gambling, but he will be consistant.  i'll give him 12 points.  petter knows he needs to score some serious points to vault into the championship, so he will twist his natural talent into desperation.  at least two early retirements will keep him below 8 more points in the final rallies.  markko is going to destroy the next two rallies.  expect a first and a second place finish.  the final rally in great britain is going to decide this championship.  gronholm has retired from the last three rallies.  expect another two retirements with a third place race to finish off the season.  the final standings and points:

i took my car in two mondays ago (09/22/2003) and expected to have it back by wednesday.  when i dropped it off, they said it would be done by friday at the latest.  oh well, what can i do, i need a car so i will just pay for 5 days.  friday rolls around and the car is not ready.  that sucks because the shop is closed on the weekends meaning at least three more days of renting the car.   monday comes and the car is not ready.  tuesday comes and the car is not ready.  finally i pick up the car on wednesday (10/01/2003) and they got the wrong fog lamp in so that wasn't replaced.  total charge for renting a car for ten days:  $375!  all because i didn't want to pay the $60/year for car rental coverage."

now that i had my disguise (if you can even consider that a disguise), i had to infiltrate the target location.  from my surroundings, the locale was possibly the city of new york, but checking my maps showed st. petersburg.  so, yes, i was infiltrating a russian installation.  from here, the rest of the dream is very fuzzy.  i do remember getting onto an elevator and having a woman roll her eyes viciously.  

i do remember some of the emotions that i felt.  when i was performing the first task, i knew that i was taking shortcuts and that my boss would be upset if he found out.  i believe the same thing happened when i was actually on my way to the base.  i was using some sort of device to track my location (probably a  urllink windows mobile  powered device, naturally) and that was against the rules of engagement."

date: mon, 6 oct 2003 18:04:05 -0700 (pdt) 

from: laura washnock-dipietro

mike,  

 

i want you to stay completely out of my life, that is, after all, why i 

broke up with you.  this means that i do not want to hear from you and i 

do not want you contacting, in any way, my friends and family.  trust me, 

they do not want to hear from you either.  i did not email you earlier 

because i did not want to talk to you.  i don't care about your new 

address and phone number.  i don't care about your new job.  in short, i 

don't care about what you are doing with your life.  i also do not care 

for you to know what is going on in my life.  

 

if you are looking for closure, here it is.  i broke up with you because 

you made me miserable.  you were emotionally abusive and controlling.  

you put me down and made me feel stupid for being myself.  when i broke 

up with you, i was too afraid of you to be this direct.  i am not anymore 

and i am sick of you trying to weasel your way back into my life.  leave 

my friends alone.  leave my family alone.  leave me alone.  

 

laura 

 



seeing as how a regular reply might not be appreciated either and i always need to get the last word in, here is my open letter of reply:



 

laura,  



first off, relax.  we have not talked since the beginning of this  

year.  i sent two emails over that period of time inquiring about your  

well-being.  i love how that is considered me trying to weasel my way  

back into your life!  i send an email to everyone in my address book about  

my new contact info and this is the reply that i get?  that is just a bit  

dramatic!  



twice you mentioned leaving your family and friends alone.  i can only  

assume that you brought this up because they received the same contact  

info email as you did.  had i known that would upset them so much, i  

definitely would have reconsidered sending it to them!  sarcasm aside, i  

will not trust you when you say they don't want to hear from me.  a few of  

your friends didn't like me while we were together and i'm sure a few more  

switched sides when you broke up with me.  i do know that certain people,  

including at least one sibling of yours, think differently.  you may have  

requested that they all shun me but that cannot affect their true  

feelings.  who is being the controlling one now?  it's a shame that you  

cannot trust them to make their own decisions.  



i made you feel stupid?  i'm sorry; i must have acted as a mirror of some  

sort, allowing you to see yourself for who you truly are.  it does not take  

much for someone whose only intellectual hobby is to watch vh1 for hours  

on end to think of themselves as being stupid.  try reading a book.   

better yet, try challenging yourself!  outside of your required courses,  

did you take anything difficult in college?  i know you didn't make it  

into the honors program, but there are some difficult classes offered to  

the rest of the school as well.  



so, you broke up with me so that i would stay completely out of your life?   

is that how it works?  why is it that so many other people have the ability  

to break up and at least be cordial?  actually, if i remember correctly,  

you have no contact whatsoever with any of your exes.  why is that?  do you  

understand how to forgive people?  are your emotional abilities so  

black-and-white that once you break up with someone, all emotion toward  

them must turn to hate?  do you even understand how to separate the  

concepts of friend and significant other?  hopefully you will learn with  

alex.  hey, he was one of my good friends back in elementary school.  he was  

probably one of the main reasons why we broke up and still i do not hate  

him.  forgive and forget.  



here is my take on the situation as a whole.  you met alex while we were  

together and while our relationship was having problems.  having a small  

shred of morality, you knew that you couldn't cheat so you decided to  

break up with me to be with him.  though we did have problems, there was  

still some good in the relationship.  while you were with alex, you had to  

channel that emotional energy somewhere.  the easiest emotion to channel  

into is hate, so there it went!  it is much easier to hate someone with  

support from people you are close to so you slandered me enough to gain  

this support.  when you saw my latest email, you felt a slight twinge of  

interest but you had to kill it.  instead of forgiving and forgetting, you  

redirected that twinge into the anger spewed forth in your email.  for that  

emotional outburst, i applaud you.  



even if i am completely wrong, know that you have now proved yourself as  

the paragon of emotional puerility you were destined to become.

the track was fairly small but i didn't fully figure it out until about half way through.  as you can see on  urllink this map , there are a few hairpin turns.  the worst was turn 3.  no matter what i did, i couldn't seem to get enough exit velocity.  if it was a real car, i would have changed the gear ratios for faster low-end acceleration.  i figured out how to gain some serious velocity through turns 1 and 2, but 3 was my down fall.  i'm sure another go at it and i would improve by at least .3 seconds a lap.  

overall, i think everyone had a good time.  jeff and crew had to leave early since they had just gotten in from across the country that morning.  his sister honestly looked like she pulled two all nighters.  you know that glazed, watery look?  she had a textbook case.  jeff will probably drag me back there, no worries.

many people have commented on my increased size (i've assumed musculature so far since most of these people wouldn't say ""man, looking a little pudgy there, mike!""), but i feel that all the added muscle mass is simply pushing the existing fat out farther.  i'm almost tempted to scale back lifting in favor of cardio, but then i wouldn't be making progress in strength.  i've added at least 25 pounds to my bench since we started working out at the end of the summer.  maybe i should just get liposuction and keep lifting!"

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"11,November,2003","urllink fcc allows home numbers to be switched to wireless phones - nov. 11, 2003 :  when i first read this article, i thought ""great!  so many people will love this feature.""  now that i really think about it, how much use is this really going to get?  ever since cell phones became popular, adding a new phone number became a routine occurance.  it is not that big of a deal to change a phone number.  i could have a skewed viewpoint because almost everyone that has my phone number also has an email address.  everytime i changed phone numbers (which happened every year in college and once again when i moved out to washington), i've sent out an email announcing the change.  it could be much more difficult for other people that do not have an alternate form of communication.

  

 i can see this being used by people that ran a business line in their home.  they can keep the same number, which is probably on business cards, websites, etc but now have it tied to a mobile phone.  since i work in the mobile phone industry, any way to get more people to switch is fine with me!  

i do see one issue with this ruling though.  up to this point, i believe that telemarketers relied on the fact that cell phones and landlines were completely seperate.  they knew which extensions mobile operators had and would not call those numbers (since it is illegal to telemarket to a cell phone since it costs the customer money).  now, that line is completely removed.  is there going to be a national database of cellular versus landlines?  how secure would that be?"

since this dog was just so darned cute, russ had to bring up the idea of getting a dog since his brother could give it away to anyone.  i said the same thing as before but pointed out that this dog wasn't going to be small for very long.  also, he would probably destroy something if he was kept in the apartment by himself for 10+ hours a day.  we agreed, no puppy for us.

on sunday, i finally made it to a donation center.  when i first moved out to washington, i brought all of my college apartment furniture, electronics and applicances.  i figured that i would have enough startup costs with moving into a new apartment and buying a car that i could use my old college crap for awhile to get me by.  i dropped quite a bit on the down payment for the car and had to buy a few essentials for the apartment (sofa, bed, desk, dresser, bookshelves, everything for the bathroom, etc) so i was glad i brought everything else.  i've slowly replaced a few items and instead of getting rid of them immediately, i just tossed them into the corner of the room!  basically, we had an extra tv, vcr and tv stand in our living room for the past three months.  kat showed me the local goodwill donation center sunday morning so i packed up the ol' focus hatchback and finally made a donation.  

i got rid of said tv, vcr and tv stand along with two huge garbage bags of clothes (cleaned and folded, thank you), microwave, toaster, coffee pot and some other assorted items.  they didn't take the tv, so i just tossed it into the garbage/recycle room in my complex.  if it's still there after trash day, i will probably take it to a real recycle center since jeff informed me that the tube contains toxic materials.  



after getting rid of so much stuff, i decided i need to fill those now-empty spaces with new stuff.  i picked up a duvet cover and blanket (both in dark blue) and then jeff and i went out shopping.  on the way to ikea, we decided to check out fry's.  it can only be described as a combination of the best parts of best buy and radio shack in a wal-mart sized setting.  automatic geekgasm.  at ikea, i picked up a  urllink frame  for my  urllink hokusai katsushika  print.  it's not terribly japanese, i know, but i simply like it for aesthetic reasons.  jeff had to continually remind me that i am heterosexual so that i wouldn't  urllink buy   urllink certain   urllink prints .  but come on, with a blue and white theme in my bedroom,  urllink this  would complement it well!  



on saturday, jeff, russ, his two visitors, rebecca and rob, and i went to  urllink rocksport  in west seattle to see  urllink michigan defeat ohio state .  i was about to say ""upset ohio state"", but we all knew who was going to win!  rocksport was an interesting place to see the game.  all but a handful of people were there specifically to cheer on the wovlerines as the seattle alumni association goes there for every game.  they served (a fairly crappy) breakfast, but service was surprisingly good for a bar at 9 am.  after the game, jeff and i hit kenneth cole ( urllink shoes  in brown/tan,  urllink shirt ,  urllink shirt  in black).  after a quick lunch, we hit the gym.  that night, kat and i went to cutters for dinner (not terribly impressed) and then had a quiet night at home."

bad astronomy saves the day and debunks the possiblity of a small nuclear-powered probe turning jupiter into a star with this  urllink article .  the critical (pun intended) points here are:

 

 the plutonium onboard galileo was kept in small pellets, none of which were near critical mass.

 the hydrogen on jupiter is of the most abundant isotope and lacks deuterium and tritium needed for a fusion reaction.

 jupiter is about 1/80th the size needed to be a self-sustaining star.

i don't really remember the play/conference/whatever, but i know that we went out to eat afterwards.  the place was called bd's, but instead of it being like bd's mongolian bbq, it was more like dixie's bbq and was fast food.  the restaurant was so darkly lit that i couldn't even read the menu and was about to just order a ""number 1 combo"" just to be safe when an altercation occured.  some guy brushed up too close to the girl that i just barely remember and so she yelled at him and shoved him.  a couple of other guys were just loitering around that area and started to make fun of her.  that's when i stepped in, put one of the guys in an arm lock and said ""do you like having the use of this arm?""  he was quiet after that."

friday turned out a bit differently than i originally expected. i knew that kat was leaving for a business trip on sunday morning and that she would be pretty busy getting ready on saturday night, so i planned on seeing her.  around 7:30 pm, mark called and said that he was going out to some bars downtown with dan and some friends.  i figured that kat, jeff, russ and i hadn't been out drinking in awhile so i thought we could all get together.  well, all the stress of trying to close on a new townhome, stress of work and stress of trying to get ready for a week-long business trip caught up to kat.  she decided that i should just go out with the guys and have fun.  no way!  if this was probably the last night i would get to see her for a week, of course i was going to try to see her.  i basically had to convince her to let me come over and that i would go out with the guys afterward.  we had a fairly quiet night at her place and i tried my damnest to wash away some of her stress.  by the time i got back to my apartment, russ was sound asleep and mark never called me to say where he would be downtown.  that ended that night.  



saturday was a bit more productive.  i figured that i wouldn't be able to see kat at all, so i was going to tackle some christmas shopping.  before i got started with that, jeff and i grabbed lunch at king and i, a thai restaurant near his apartment.  not too bad, but their take on ""3 star"" spicy was definitely including white man penalty and was thus fairly mild.  i then headed over to the local mall and spent a good three hours shopping.  i was looking mostly for gifts for my parents but i seemed to find more gifts for myself.  not surprising.  



kat called me soon after that saying that she was mostly ready for her trip and that we should hang out for a bit.  we originally decided to grab coffee some place, but by the time we actually got around to leaving her place, it was dinner time.  she felt like mexican, so we started off toward fremont since she knew of a fairly authentic restaurant out that way.  traffic over the bridge to seattle was horrendous, so we turned back to bellevue.  we hit  urllink spazzo , which recently changed from mediterranean to italian. and had a fairly nice meal.  the wine was better than the entrees and the goat cheese appetizer was served with bread that was impossibly hard and terribly over-soaked in olive oil.  all in all, a nice evening, as most are with her!  



today was completely lazy...  i didn't do anything productive until 3 pm, unless you count making eggs for breakfast and playing an hour of grand theft auto iii as productive.  russ and i visited  urllink caffe ladro  so i could read more of the brothers karamazov and he could study for accounting.  it was good going out with him since we spend so much time in the apartment."

here is how i did it.  instead of wearing my normal cross-trainer shoes to play rball, i was wearing my turf shoes.  turf shoes have amazing traction on almost any surface, including the hardwood floor of the rball court.   whenever i land from a jump, i keep my foot perpendicular to my shoulders until i land, when i rotate my foot away from my body for added balance.  that is how you are supposed to land.  well, when i landed this time, i went to rotate my foot but my shoe decided to have super traction and not move.  all of the rotational force went straight to the inner portion of my left knee.  

it was 10 pm by the time i got home, so i couldn't see a doctor on monday.  the next morning, i waited until i heard from kat to make an appointment since i figured her dad (a doctor) would be able to make a good recommendation.  when i called to make an appointment at 11 am, they were booked for the day and i had to wait until wednesday.  the x-ray shows that i definitely did some serious damage and that i also have a bone shard taken off the medial portion of my left knee.  because of the amount of swelling, the doc recommended that i get an mri.  that was done the same day but i will not get the results until at least friday afternoon.  the current prognosis is a torn mcl, stretched acl, torn meniscus and the bone shard.  lovely.  

i'm currently wearing a huge brace but the pain is not so bad.  it comes and goes and luckily i can walk fairly well.  i missed a day and a half of work, so i'm a bit behind now."

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"23,December,2003","disclaimer:  for no real reason, i have always disliked walmart.  maybe it was because, for the longest time, there were no walmarts nearby either my hometown of livonia, mi or my college town of ann arbor, mi.  that has since changed, with stores in or near both cities.  maybe it was because walmart always had a southern, poor slant to it.  maybe it was because we had a similar store, meijer's, in our area and i was pledging a local allegiance.  for whatever reason, i never liked walmart.  



i've always heard that walmart was an ""evil"" company.  from details like hiring illegal aliens for stock and cleaning work to treating ""regular"" employees poorly to pushing around suppliers, the comments swirled around and painted a dirty portrait.  when i was back working at the daily with scott as my manager, he spoke of walmart as being worse than an other company he knew of.  he had facts from reputible sources, and though being an activist, used them properly.  now having read this  urllink article  from fastcompany.com, i'm starting to see the details about how walmart interacts with suppliers.  from first glance, it does seem evil, overbearing and monopolistic.  at the same time, isn't that what capitalism is all about?  a mostly-free market for companies to do as they please?  walmart doesn't force smaller suppliers to cut costs, walmart is just such a large and successful company that the small suppliers need to be up to walmart standards.

so, the holiday parties last month.  all three parties were right in a row this year:  thursday was the organization-wide party at emp, friday was the team-wide party at a lodge at snoqualmie pass and saturday was kat's party at some little restaurant in puyallup.  thursday started off very slowly.  i was supposed to meet some of the younger members of my team at emp around 7:30 pm and eventhough i got there at 7:45 pm, i was still early.  eventually, everyone showed up and the party picked up.  the food was good, but the two drink tickets didn't last very long.  being the ingenious people that we are, us microsoft people, we figured out that we could simply exit the building, come back in, show our id and get two more tickets.  of course i didn't do this, but my id was used by a non-microsoftie for this purpose.  afterward, a few of us were supposed to go out to a bar, but we all parted ways for a bit and we were supposed to reconvene 15 minutes later.   15 minutes later, one of the girls still hadn't showed up.  we were all a bit drunk and antsy to get away from the formal party, so we just left.  four of us went over to a friends place and continued the drinking and watched some tv.  i ended up fitting five people in my car, dropped them all off, and called it a night.  

the next day, the team party was supposed to start at 10 am, but since i knew there was no rush, i didn't end up getting there until 12:30 pm.  the drive up to snoqualmie pass was interesting at least for the fact that it was the first snow i had ever seen in washington.  the farther up the mountain, the more snow there was (shocking, i know).  by the time i hit the exit for the pass, traffic was down to 30 mph.  i actually passed someone on my team on the exit, which wasn't surprising since he had a rwd bimmer with bald tires.  anyway, most of the day was pretty laid back.  a few of the highlights included me running the white elephant gift exchange (including a box of old atari games, a nascar coffee table book and a bike axle), playing ddr, and a snowball fight that included someone in a hot tub.  i picked up kat from the airport that night, but i can't remember the rest of the evening.  

the final day of holiday parties was at some crappy little restaurant in a crappy little town far far south of seattle.  this was with kat's coworkers, who had an average age of just about 35.  it was slightly odd socializing with them, but luckily we got a table with the friendliest of the bunch.  the food was horrible, the drinks were crap, and the supposed white elephant gift exchange wasn't!  kat brought a gag gift, since that's the point of a white elephant gift exchange, yet some of the other gifts included a fondue set, a set of nice martini glasses and a clock from pottery barn.  for dessert, i ordered decaf coffee.  since i was awake until 5 am and got about two hours of sleep all night, i believe it wasn't decaf.  anyway, the parties overall were typical work holiday parties."

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"12,January,2004","last night, i originally planned on leaving work a bit early, taking a nap, having a quick bite to eat and then hitting the gym with jeff.  none of that happened!  around 5:30 pm, eric and i were talking about the new laptop he just ordered.  i told him not to buy office from dell since i could get a good deal on a legit copy of office 2003 from work.  i decided to run to the company store right then since i was tired and needed a bit of fresh air.  after that, lee sent me a chat request and convinced me to join him and some of his ms friends for dinner.  we went to cucina cucina (a decent to mediocre italian restaurant, thankfully we get 2-for-1 specials) and had a fun time.  it was good to meet new people, but i sometimes forget how horribly dorky we can all be.  i explained how microsofties and non-microsofties have difficulty mingling and there needs to be a certain percentage (we estimated 60%) of non-microsofties for a group to work.  

i still planned on going to the gym with jeff, but he was feeling fairly comfortable at home and wanted to skip it.  good thing, since russ called me soon after wanting to get drinks to unwind from a 13 hour day.  we went to  urllink tap house , he got dinner and i got a liquid dinner of an emerald city tea and a manhattan.  i pretty much ordered the tea (vodka, gin, rum, midori, pineapple, sprite) because it already looked like russ and i were on a date, so i had to get something fruity and served in a hurricane glass.  the manhattan was used to bring up my testosterone levels afterward.  we had a good discussion and i'm glad i skipped working out.  i can always go a bit harder tonight."
24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"12,January,2004","kat and i had quite a relaxing and enjoyable weekend, if i may say so myself.  originally, we had planned to go to  urllink dahlia lounge  for dinner on friday, but we both had a hard week and figured we wouldn't be up for such a nice dinner.  instead, we ended up going to  urllink wasabi bistro  and had some of the best sushi available in western washington.  we tried two of their signature rolls, the spicy 101 and the belltown.  other than an overabundance of mayo on the spicy 101, the meal was great.  kat had a craving for edamame and that was satisfied by the complementary bowl served with every dinner.  

much of saturday morning was spent lounging around my apartment, but it was definitely not a waste of time.  much of the afternoon was spent at starbucks:  kat doing work, me just playing around on the internet.  that evening, we made the  urllink first meal in her new townhome .  we made spinach and cheese ravioli, fresh bread and a mixed greens salad.  all in all, very enjoyable.  before we could make dinner, however, i had to put together the table and chairs we would need to eat off!  i've gotten pretty good at putting together ikea furniture, so it didn't take too long.  

sunday saw me fighting with my server for a good part of the afternoon and then having dinner at kat's parents.  we played a dominos game called mexican train and then had a lovely filet dinner.  her dad and i did most of the talking, but i think everyone enjoyed themselves."

basically, my bedroom is not in the most optimal configuration.  both of my tall bookshelves are covering up one window completely and part of another window.  so, i started thinking about alternative arrangements.  knowning me, i couldn't just visualize this or write it out on a sheet paper, i decided to measure and model my room in photoshop.

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"11,January,2004","i've been wrestling with hardware issues for about four days now.  that is what i get for naming a server fireball!  basically, the machine that has been my internet router, nat box, development web server, database server, rdp proxy has gone through quite a few upgrades.  it originally was my old overclocking desktop (thus, ""fireball"") running a 300 mhz celeron.  it was upgraded to a 500 mhz piii and it currently has a 700 mhz duron.  a month or so ago, i bought a new 120 gb drive for my desktop (thanks,  urllink slickdeals !) and last week i finally got around to putting my old 30 gb drive into fireball.  

the problems started then.  since the 30 gb drive was already in my desktop, i decided to install openbsd 3.4 on the drive before transferring it to the server.  that install went smoothly, but the drive would not boot when i transferred it.  i figured it just didn't like the transfer, so i reinstalled openbsd while in fireball.  when i tried to boot after the second install, the bootloader would come up with crap like ""@$%&@#$&*@#$#$%!@#(&(^%"".  after 45 minutes of playing around with the bootloader, the bios and the boot sequence, i finally figured out that it wouldn't boot unless the drive was the primary on the ide chain.  ok, finally got the new drive up and running!  when installing obsd, my first steps are to install the ports tree, tcsh, vim, the source and add 'mbibik' as a user.  i got as far as compiling tcsh static when the machine just froze, hard.  i figured, whatever, just a random lockup.   nope, anytime i taxed the processor, the machine would freeze.  obviously (at least to me), this seemed like a heat issue.  i opened the case to check out the cpu fan, but it's a fairly small (aka cramped) case so i couldn't see the fan behind the power supply.  i monitored the cpu temp and it never seemed to get into dangerous territory.   

i gave up at this point and told russell the internet would be down for awhile (no server, no nat, no internet).  i started to play with it again, but there isn't much you can do when the damned thing freezes every 15 minutes!  i gave up trying to install tcsh, vim, etc and just started surfing the net from my desktop.  oddly enough, it didn't lock up.  at this point, i realized that interactive activities such as installing or compiling are probably accessing the disk more than just using the box as a router (which would only access the disk to periodically write logs).  i switched back to the old drive, and all is well.  too bad my 30 gb drive is fried!"

the remembered dream from last night consisted of some sort of party.  it was possibly a party for me, or just a party in general.  i believe it was a party for me since i was given a car (an audi tt, or at least the shell of one.   someone said the rest would be in next week.  odd choice of car since i do not and have never wanted a tt.) and there was an interesting gag gift.  basically, someone took all of my prized possesions, which curiously included a house, shrunk them down and locked them in a glass case for everyone to look at.  all throughout the party i never noticed this case.  once everyone had left, it finally revealed itself and of course i tried to pry it open to retreive my things!  it was a long case, probably 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and high.  the case was in segments, each with a sealed door.  after attempting to pry each door open, the last segment contained what looked like just a piece of yellow paper.  this door opened, and out flew a few miniature (fruit fly-sized) bees!  i'm not allergic nor phobic of bees, but i am not a fan.  for some reason, my mind told me that an ex-girlfriend, emily, had done all of this.  made no sense!"

well, last weekend i went back to detroit for the second time in three weeks.  the main reason for going back was to attend the  urllink auto show  and to see friends and family.  i arrived around 6 am, rented a car, drove back to livonia and just fell down dead in my bed.  once noon rolled around, my aunt and i went to the plymouth ice show ( urllink image gallery ) and just hung out for a bit.  the ice sculptures cannot really be considered art, though some of the pieces showed some technical skill and creativity.  also, art doesn't usually melt after two weeks...  it was cold enough for my body to shut down blood flow to my hands, so much so that i had difficulty using keys to get back into the car to get warm.  

the rest of the evening was spent with chris.  we hit twelve oaks to grab some  urllink panera  (they really need to open one here in washington:  fresh and chewy breads, sharp cheeses and choice cuts of meat make a great sandwich) and then sat around his place until the chris and lindsay engagement party ( urllink image gallery ) started.  it was a laid back affair consisting of wine and beer and conversation.  this was the first party i've been to with megan, iren and lindsday where they didn't go on a 1.5 hour tangent about their childhood, a discussion which no one else can participate in.  no offense girls, just don't do that again!  i talked to marty for a bit and his opening bit was classic marty:  

ma: ""have you ever watched twin peaks?"" 

mi: ""not really, a few episodes, but i know you are a big fan."" 

ma: ""so why did you go to snoqualmie then?"" 

my first reaction was that this was just marty being marty (if you know him, you know what i mean.  otherwise, you aren't going to meet him, so don't worry about it), and then i realized that twin peaks was filmed in washington, near a waterfall and then it clicked.  i didn't feel like defending my choice to visit snoqualmie for a non-twin peaks reason and marty was just trying to show that he has been following my site.  casey, one of the northvillians that chris used to hang out with every week back in high school, was also at the party.  by the eighth beer, he was becoming quite the extrovert.  he knew what he was doing, so he was enjoying the party laughing at him whilst he laughed inside.  

the next morning was the auto show ( urllink image gallery ) with my dad and grandpa.  honestly and unfortunately, i wasn't terribly impressed with the show this year.  that shouldn't be much of a surprise since this is the first year where i've been in the actual market for a car.  previously, i was most excited about the exotic concept cars but now i want to see vechicles that are in showrooms that i can and want to purchase.  since i just recently purchased a car, i was looking toward the future, toward what should be my next car.  based on the fact that the focus is a three-year purchase, that will put my next round at the summer of 2006.  considering that i should be able to afford a much nicer car, i was looking at the bmw m3 and the audi s4 as possibilities.  i took many pictures of each, and got a good feel inside and out for the look of the cars.  the m3 has a terribly dated interior and it will be redesigned within the next 18 months.  the redesign could take the car in any direction, basically invalidating any observation of the current model.  the s4 has a delicious interior and the exterior styling is sedate enough yet still sporty.  while this car is a sedan, the back seat leg room is laughable at best.  with the drivers seat fully back, i could barely fit in the s4.  in contrast, i had plenty of leg room in the infiniti g35 coupe, though head room was an issue there.  hopefully by the time i am completely fed up with the focus, a new car will hit my target requirements: 

0-60 mph  

mature styling, inside and out (no more thoughts of the sti or evo) 

high  urllink build quality  (odd, i didn't realize that audi was so far down the list...) 

ample room for 4 

more to come 

i wholeheartedly recommend the infiniti site for  urllink car comparison .  their tool pulls in just about every specification you need for comparing cars.

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"19,February,2004","i believe george carlin said it best:  



here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?  



you simply do not need ten. the list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten. here's what happened:  



about 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line. they knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that god had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.  



well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10? why not 9 or 11? i'll tell you why- because 10 sound official. ten sounds important! ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed). so having ten commandments was really a marketing decision! it is clearly a bullshit list. it's a political document artificially inflated to sell better. i will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical. i am going to use the roman catholic version because those were the ones i was taught as a little boy.  



let's start with the first three:  



i am the lord thy god thou shalt not have strange gods before me  



thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain  



thou shalt keep holy the sabbath  



right off the bat the first three are pure bullshit. sabbath day? lord's name? strange gods? spooky language! designed to scare and control primitive people. in no way does superstitious nonsense like this apply to the lives of intelligent civilized humans in the 21st century. so now we're down to 7. next:  



honor thy father and mother  



obedience, respect for authority. just another name for controlling people. the truth is that obedience and respect shouldn't be automatic. they should be earned and based on the parent's performance. some parents deserve respect, but most of them don't, period. you're down to six.  



now in the interest of logic, something religion is very uncomfortable with, we're going to jump around the list a little bit.  



thou shalt not steal  



thou shalt not bear false witness  



stealing and lying. well actually, these two both prohibit the same kind of behavior- dishonesty. so you don't really need two you combine them and call the commandment ""thou shalt not be dishonest"". and suddenly you're down to 5.  



and as long as we're combining i have two others that belong together:  



thou shalt not commit adultry  



thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife  



once again, these two prohibit the same type of behavior. in this case it is marital infidelity. the difference is- coveting takes place in the mind. but i don't think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else's wife because what is a guy gonna think about when he's waxing his carrot? but, marital infidelity is a good idea so we're gonna keep this one and call it ""thou shalt not be unfaithful"". and suddenly we're down to four.  



but when you think about it, honesty and infidelity are really part of the same overall value so, in truth, you could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments and give them simpler language, positive language instead of negative language and call the whole thing ""thou shalt always be honest and faithful"" and we're down to 3.  



thou shalt not covet thy neighbor""s goods  



this one is just plain fuckin' stupid. coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going! your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays ""o come o ye faithful"", and you want one too! coveting creates jobs, so leave it alone. you throw out coveting and you're down to 2 now- the big honesty and fidelity commandment and the one we haven't talked about yet:  



thou shalt not kill  



murder. but when you think about it, religion has never really had a big problem with murder. more people have been killed in the name of god than for any other reason. all you have to do is look at northern ireland, cashmire, the inquisition, the crusades, and the world trade center to see how seriously the religious folks take thou shalt not kill. the more devout they are, the more they see murder as being negotiable. it depends on who's doin the killin' and who's gettin' killed. so, with all of this in mind, i give you my revised list of the two commandments:  



thou shalt always be honest and faithful to the provider of thy nookie.  



and  



thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course they pray to a different invisible man than you.  



two is all you need; moses could have carried them down the hill in his fuckin' pocket. i wouldn't mind those folks in alabama posting them on the courthouse wall, as long as they provided one additional commandment:  



thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself."

i finally moved off the daily servers for both my email and my web hosting.  the email wasn't a big deal since yahoo is free and i just forward everything from umich anyway.  keep emailing me at mbibik at umich dot edu, since i might not stay with yahoo.  the web hosting, on the other hand, was a big deal.  my gallery was taking up at least a gig and no host would charge less than $39/month for that much space.  well, i found a free host for most of my site and then i'm hosting the galleries at home (thus the mbibik.dyndns.org url).   no, i can't tell you where i'm hosting, but you can sort of figure it out if you are smart.  

kat and i have been up and down lately, but she is in italy for two weeks so hopefully things will improve (absense makes the heart, blah blah blah).  unfortunately, she had a slight hiccup with her flight plans!  her flight from seattle to chicago left on time, but due to weather it couldn't land and had to circle for an extra two hours.  this made her miss the connecting flight from chicago to rome!  her sister flew in from north carolina so they could fly together to rome so she skipped the flight to be with kat.  now they are both trying to find another flight to rome.  the next direct flight that is available isn't until saturday night and american airlines keeps telling them to fly to london and then home for a standby flight to rome.  no matter what, i would be very upset.   you can't really get pissed since there is no control over the weather, but very upset nontheless.  

my car is really pissing me off lately.   purchased on 06/27/2003 for about $18k and 8 months later it is only worth $10k.  i still owe about that much!  anyway, it looks like i haven't posted about my car problems over the past few months.  my cel (check engine light) came on during normal driving.  nothing seemed amis, but i made a service appointment anyway.  by the time the appointment arrived, the cel was off.  they took it and ran some tests anyway.  they replaced a fuel hose and said the car should be fine.  i took it home that night and the cel went back on the very next day!  i waited a couple weeks before making another appointment.  during those few weeks, the cel would go on for a couple days then go back off for awhile.  nothing really seemed wrong with the car until i checked my fuel logs.  the car was getting 17 mpg!  this car is rated for 27 mpg, so something was definitely borked.  i took it in and this time the cel was on when they received it.  they replaced an 02 sensor and again said the car was fine.  well, i completely grannied the next tank of gas and got 22 mpg.  not bad, but not good either.  i went back to my normal driving style and i'm still getting 17 mpg.  i could be driving a wrx for that sort of gas mileage!  i talked to the service tech and he claims he has seens focii get 17 mpg and there was no solution.  great.  

i finally just decided to ignore the gas mileage since i'm not driving that much anyway.  about two weeks ago, i was simply changing a preset on my radio and it decides to completely freak out.  now, it goes through this cycle of playing 0.5 seconds of music then turning off for 1.5 seconds, constantly rebooting.  what make its even more annoying is that you have a 0.2 second window while the radio is off to hit the power button so that it will stay off.  i'm sure i can fix it by pulling the plug (disconnect the battery), i just haven't gotten around to it."

first scene:  i'm sitting down and playing some sort of matching game, seems like mastermind, with quarters.  an older lady approaches from nowhere and demands to know where my gamer card is (if you have been to gameworks or dave & busters, you know that instead of using quarters, you get a credit card of sorts that you can put money on.  i show a pocket full of quarters, implying that i'm just playing with quarters and she storms off.   she returns about 5 minutes later and hands me a large stack of gamer chips (4 $25, 2 $10, 2 $5, 4 $1) and a fist fill of twizzlers.  the look she gives me as she walks off was, ""i've been in your place before, kid.  have some fun and enjoy the sugar!"".  possibly she thought i was poor since i only showed about 5 dollars with in quarters.  i vaguely remember winning a lot of money on the mastermind game and then being given a tour of the facility.  the man in charge was giving the tour and reminded me of  urllink tom poston  from the newhart show, but with a suit that rod roddy would wear.   well, a suit he would have worn, since he  urllink died  of breast cancer.  during the tour, i remember passing by a small room in the back with mirrors on the walls and a rainbow motif adorning the ceiling.  he said that was in case anyone felt like dancing and could also be rented out.  oddly enough, it was empty and the lights were off.  i can only imagine how those rainbows would look with the full house lights!  i know i would want to shake my groove thang, and probably go suck on a popsicle or eat some sausage.  

second scene:  the dream gets fuzzy for a bit, but i remember after the tour there was this one counter way in the back with no one around it.  the person running it is none other than beth manoongian, an ""acquaintance"" from school.  this game was a trivia game with a twist.  the questions are extremely difficult but the prize for answering a single question runs in the millions of dollars.  i decide to give it a shot, hoping that beth will help me out a little bit.  as she pulls the question from a long box of cards, she places it on ledge face down in front of me, then gets a phone call.  while she isn't watching, i try to see what the answer is, but can't quite make it out.  it looks like ""yeh"" to me backwards.  the question was something like ""what is the beach on jo beach?"".  sort of a trick question, but i thought i already had the answer.   i hem and haw for a bit, then exclaim ""yeh!"".  the answer was actually ""lev"", which doesn't make sense to me in the dream or in the waking world.  since playing the game is free, i have her pull out another card.  by this time, someone else has joined me at the counter.  this person seemed to be between 18-22 years old, male, dark hair, reminded me of a frat boy.  the next question wasn't even a question, it was something along the lines of ""(someforeignname) is furious.""  i think the riddle was that you had to figure out the country that would give out a name like that then give the translation for ""furious"".  the random guy and i looked at each other trying to figure it out and then i woke up.

so, i've played a lot of street hockey, but i've never played on a team or in any sort of organization fashion.  the closest i've come to organization was playing at elbel field in ann arbor where they kept a list of players.  first come, first serve, so as a person decided to take a break, the next person on the list got to hop in.  that pales in comparison to a real league, so i cannot even imagine what i'm in for tomorrow night.  i've watched enough hockey in my life to know what to do!  right, i'll be just fine.  no worries.   i'm going to die.

next up was the '92 camaro.  the owner was about 10 minutes late, but all was forgiven when i saw the quality of this car.  there is a slight dent just behind the driver side door that is starting to rust and there is a modicum of rust above the rear passenger wheel well.  other than that, the vehicle looked practically new!  the interior was a bit worn, but no damage.  the clutch was in good shape, the stereo is brand new, the tires are new, the battery is new and most of the suspension was new.  needless to say, i was pretty impressed.  it was only an rs, which means that it has 140 hp but 180 lb-ft of torque (and still better than the 130 hp and 135 lb-ft in my focus!).  since the car is in such good shape, i really doubt that i will be able to talk him down from the $2,000 price.  

considering how impressed i was with the car, i called up my insurance agent.  if i add a second car to my policy, it will drop the price on the focus from $672 to $637.  full coverage on the camaro would be $298 and just the basics will get run me $198.  not that bad at all!  i was originally considering paying for a parking spot in a lot near my apartment, but then i realized that i should be able to park at work.  as long as i swap cars at least once a week and move the cars around every other day, i shouldn't get in trouble from security.  as soon as they say something, i will pay for the lot ($50/month).  

if i don't think of anything i've forgotten and no one else says this is a dumb idea, i think i'm going to buy it on monday.  i'd love to have it for the weekend, especially while kat is gone, but i really shouldn't make a rash decision."

 dream from last night:  i cannot remember the bulk of the dream, but it involved a large number of my friends from both microsoft and umich at a presentation of some sort.  everyone was sitting in rows of chairs waiting for it to start.  i was supposed to drive to this with one of the devs on my team, matt, but when i got there, he was sitting with matt weber.  just before the presentation started, i remember that i borrowed jeff's can opener and he needed it back!  i was quite concerned since this was a limited edition can opener.  oddly enough, there were shelves and shelves of shoe boxes and skiing equipment to the side of the presentation room.  after a frantic search, i finally found the can opener at the bottom of a shoe box.  the can opener was a wrx model in sonic yellow, which would explain why i was frantic to find it (the impreza wrx in sonic yellow is a very rare sight).  that doesn't explain why i am having crazy dreams.

 floorburn improved to a record of 3-2 after our 6-2 win on tuesday.  i scored twice, so i'm back as leading scorer.

 wall of meat (flag football) is perfect so far at 2-0!  we had a come from behind win on saturday with our new quarterback, but i can definitely see the team improving from here out.

 i'm getting closer to buying the camaro.  the owner just needs to get it to pass emissions and then i will almost certainly buy it.

 the ny auto show is tomorrow thus i expect information about the 2005 subarus to be released tomorrow.  rumor has it that the wrx will go a complete redesign for the '06 model year, so maybe buying an '05 would be silly.  i don't want to look dated that fast!"

soon after we had sat down, a pair of gentlemen were seated directly behind us.  our backs were mostly turned to them, but kat could tell that the older of the two, maybe 45-50 years old, was consistently staring at her.  this skeeved her out a bit, but was soon ignored.  after we had finished our entree and started to dig into some creme brulee, our waiter approached carrying two glasses of red wine.  he informed us that the man behind us offered two glasses of his fine argentinean wine.  we raised our glasses and turned to the man and thanked him.  he said ""enjoy, or as we would say in norway, skord.""  at this point, we felt fairly awkward.  here was two men that had offered us nice wine and now expected us to at least talk to them.  i basically told kat to hurry up and drink the wine so we could say a quick word with them and then get the hell out of there!  kat didn't want to gulp the wine, figuring that would be even more rude.  eventually, we started to talk to them while we were all still seated.  he asked if we were here on business and when i replied in the negative, he said ""yes, you two look too romantic for business.""  the older man was doing all the talking and when he informed me that his companion was visiting from norway, i just assumed that he couldn't speak english very well.  the older man then complemented kat on her looks and said something about us being an attractive couple.  kat and were both obviously nervous and annoyed, but we were still stuck talking.  the man finally said something about his wife and then started babbling.  i couldn't understand a word he was saying and katherine was having trouble hearing, so we basically turned back to our table to finish the wine and escape.  after drinking the last drop, we got up to leave and i approached the man to at least shake his hand.  after shaking, he gently held on to my hand and placed his other hand on my upper arm, basically trapping me there.  he asked if we enjoyed the wine, if we would like to sit down and have another glass.  i told him we had to leave and we basically fled.  at this point, i heard his companion speak and he said something in accent-free english.  he understood the language, he was just being quiet because he was obviously embarrassed by what was going on!  kat was, understandbly, a bit disturbed by the whole situation.  ugh."

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"03,May,2004","my take on gmail.  

ok, i've only been using it for a short while, but i haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.  the first issue is that all email is sorted by ""conversations"", which is basically what everyone but microsoft and gmail call threads.  for those of you that don't know what that means, a thread/conversation is just what it sounds like, a collection of email messages relating to a specific topic.  on the most basic level, a conversation is an original message and any replies to that message.  certain mail clients assign a thread id and thus you can change the message subject and it will still be a part of the original thread/conversation.  either gmail or yahoo doesn't support thread id because i changed the subject on a thread and gmail started a new ""conversation"".  



there are a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which is interesting for a webmail client.  seeing as i used pine for my email for 6 years, i'm quite used to navigating my email with a keyboard...  in pine!  using it in gmail isn't as easy as i expected.  there are keyboard shortcuts for navigating various messages and conversations, but very basic actions, like cancelling the composition of a message, has to be done by mouse.  i do love that the keyboard shortcut for reporting spam is the excalamation key...  it just goes so well with most spam: ""ge.t a m.a$siv3 mem.b3r! buttercup obtuse bingo cxoiuqweijfd4klhjd7""  my natural response is ""!"".  



gmail has a concept of ""all mail"" and ""archive"".  the main action for all emails is to ""archive"" it.  it doesn't place the message in the trash, it doesn't move it to a specific folder, it just moves the email out of your inbox.  the only way to view archived mails is to use the all mail view.  all mail shows any mail in your inbox, your sent mail ""folder"" and anything you have archived.  it does not show any spam or trash emails.  



instead of supporting folders like most email clients (web or desktop), gmail has introduced the concept of ""labels"".  well, i shouldn't say introduced, but this is the first time i've seen it in relation to an email client.  instead of storing a conversation (see above) in various default or unique folders, you can assign one or more labels to the conversation.  let's say that you wanted to save all conversations from a specific person in a specific folder and you wanted to save all conversations about a specific topic in a specific folder, what happens if your specifics collide?  do you try to decide which folder takes presidence?  with labels, you can give the conversation labels for both the sender and the topic.  like most folder views, there is a list of labels so you can jump to the list of all conversations with a specific label.  



gmail also supports filters which works hand in hand with labels.  you can filter on sender, receiver, subject, words in the body and words missing from the body.  the actions you can take are skip inbox (meaning it places the mail into the archive (see above)), apply a specific label or move it directly to the trash.  you cannot mark anything as spam through the filter.



one little feature that i saw in their help files but they did not actually implement related to attachments.  instead of showing the common and generic paper clip icon to denote an attachment, gmail would use an icon to represent the file type of the attachment.  if it was a pdf, the common pdf icon would be used, etc.  i tested this out, and it's just a paper clip.  shucky darn.  



overall, i'm sure that i will get used to conversation view, labels and archive and be very happy with my free 1000 mb webmail client harnessing google!"

""  

is that a truism?  do you believe that, in a mentality lacking love and kindness, the only logical conclusion would be that all actions would be driven by self-interest?  the implication here is that self-interest is inherently a negative characteristic.  is it not possible that, while looking out for yourself, you can also look out for others?  the man that helps and cares for others may draw greater fortune to himself.  by looking out for others, you are in a way looking out for yourself?

24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"24,May,2004","my brain is triggered to wake up if i hear a diesel engine idling outside of my window.  why?  well, back in senior year, i was sharing a parking permit with a roommate.  i was almost towed twice for parking in my apartment lot without the permit but i heard the idling tow truck and woke up!  anyway, there was a truck idling outside of my apartment this morning around 7 am and thus i woke up."

anyway, during the daily jeff-and-mike lunch extravaganza, something a bit humorous happened.  jeff and i have a pretty set list of restaurants we go to (quizno's, qdoba, chipotle, ribeye, nasai teriyaki, red robin, matt's famous, arby's, taj palace, yen ching, etc) and some of the places have started to remember us.  today at one of the usuals, my order number was 29.  the cashier said ""29, close to 30...   are you over 30?"".  i had remembered from a previous conversation that she said she had been out of school for 10 years and just got her degree last year so i assumed she was about 30 though she looked not a day over 21.  my response was ""no, a bit lower"", giving her a thumbs down motion.  

""29?"" 

""no."" 

""27?"" 

""nope, lower."" 

at this point, she just looked at me, scared to give another incorrect answer.  i held up two fingers, said ""23"" and transitioned to three fingers.  she was quite flabergasted and made some commented about how i looked so much older while she looked so much younger saying that people don't think of her as a day older than 20, 19 even!  

funny stuff."

just drive around the cones as fast as your can, right?  yes-and no.  try cracking off six perfect, consecutive, emergency lane-changes at freeway speeds (some well above) with a margin of error at less than one inch.  sure, this sound challenging until one realizes each cone arrives at less than a one second interval-the whole thing takes less than six seconds in these vehicles.  this is one test that best reveals a car's evil side.  a propensity to push, get loose, or even spin is ever more apparent while all four ties are howling at, in some cases, 80 mph.  that's right, the speeds listed above are timed averages between the entry and exit markers along the 600-foot course-not how fast the car is actually traveling along its curvy line, which is, in fact, much faster."
24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"20,June,2004","as you can tell from my last post, i have a new car!  well, almost new.  let me tell the story.  

about this time last year, i was car shopping.  i had almost signed on an evo when better judgment told me to go with something cheaper to start.  also, 271 hp is a bit much for someone that had never driven a manual before.  i decided to use my grandfathers ford discount and just pick up a focus.  it had decent looks and handling and the interior was fairly accomodating.  i have yet to find nicer seats (not even in the svt).  while i was trying to pick out the focus i wanted, the sales person i was working with kept mentioning the svt.  when we finally went out to the dealer lot to grab an automatic zx3 for a test drive, we had to pass over at least five svts to find a single zx3.  obviously the cars were not selling well.  

i bought the camaro about two months ago and i've only put about 200 miles on it.  i wasn't getting any better at the manual, so i just stopped trying.  i'm always looking at car forums when the svt was mentioned.  i cannot remember the context but someone was praising it on a subaru forum.  a car has to be at least moderately respectable for someone entrenched in another manufacturer's camp to praise it.  just on a whim, i decided to look up new/used svts in the area.  the only one i could find was a 2004 model with about 940 miles on it.  i figured that had to be a typo for 9,400 so i figured i'd email the dealer.  nope, not a typo.  an older gentleman traded in a svt lightning for an svt focus and then decided it seemed too young for him.  he returned it 3 weeks later.  

they gave me an overnight test drive and i decided this is what my car should have been all along.  tighter (but not punishing) suspension, better brakes, better looks, better acceleration and an amazing transmission.  going to this car from the camaro is very eye-opening.  the getrag trans is just a thing of beauty.  i think the only better transmission out there for under $35k is in the s2000.  the dealership first put the car on the market at $19,995 (or just about what the car cost new) and that didn't fly.  the salesperson also offered me only $7,500 for the zx3 and an interest rate of 7.49%.  given those numbers, my monthly payment would have been $677.17!  the price of the car was talked down to $17,500 then $16,900 and finally $16,500.  the trade in on the zx3 was brought up to $7,750 then $8,000 then $8,500.  the apr was brought down to 6.49%.  after the trade-in, loan payoff (of the zx3), license, document fees (yeah wtf), taxes and $1,000 down, i had to finance $17,238.75.  with an apr of 6.49%, my monthly payment will only be $528.27.  

the more i drive this car, the more i love it.  i am not quite used to the 6-speed but i've had multiple people tell me i'm much smoother in the svt than in the camaro.  that is just a put-down in disguise but i'll take it anyway!"

 kat and i didn't do much this fourth of july weekend.  we both had difficult weeks (especially the night where i left work at 12:45 am and then was up for the next day before 7 am) so we just took it easy.  her parents backyard overlooks much of seattle so we were able to see four different fireworks displays at once (elliot bay, gasworks, yarrow bay and kirkland).

 tonight was the second game of the summer floorburn season.  i'm captain already and i've already made a mistake.  i didn't inform everyone we had a game this week (assuming that the manager would take care of that like last season) and only 4 people showed up.  a couple people subbed for us and we ended up winning 3-1!  i almost had a hat trick but the pass i got right in front of the goal was actually about to go into the goal so i just let it go by!

 i've spent about eight hours working on my yearly review for microsoft and i'm only about a third of the way completed.  it is important but not that important.  i just want a fatty raise so i can afford my new car and my $1,570/month rent.

 this happened two weekends ago, but eric of jenn&eric fame was in town so kat, eric and i grabbed some dinner and dessert.  we had a good time, but it didn't last long enough.  i had an early morning appointment so i had to call the night around 9 pm.

 the new car is still super sweet.  to measure how sweet it is, i picked up a  urllink g-tech performance meter pro .  i haven't had a chance to try it out yet.  well, i haven't had a piece of flat, dry, non-cop-infested road to really wring out the car and measure with it yet.  in time.

 while the car is still super sweet, the oh-so-smooth shifter is becoming less smooth.  there is some hesitation as the shifter returns to neutral on the way to the next gear.  it almost seems like the linkage is jammed.  oh well, it should work itself out in time otherwise it is going to the dealer!  i didn't drive this car hard at all yet and i haven't had a gear grind nor have i missed a shift.  if there is a problem, it wasn't my fault.

 i've been playing a ton of gt3 lately, now that russ has moved out.  i can play the really long races or long sets of races and just leave the ps2 running while i go to work.  i can play a bit, do something else then go back to an unmolested ps2.  i've already won an f1 car so now it's basically a game of ""how many times can i pass everyone before i win!"".  i love that game."

the real kicker here is that i didn't give my apartment enough notice that i was leaving.  when i went from the year lease to a month-to-month lease, they never said anything about a ""twenty day notice"".  on a month-to-month, that's a huge amount of notice!  i wanted to move out at the end of july but they are so graciously allowing me to pay $1470 for all of august.  they said that if someone moves into the apartment, they will pro-rate the amount and pay me back.  i somehow doubt that is going to happen!  sigh."
24336.male.24.Technology.Leo.xml,"20,July,2004","ok, really weird dream.  here are some of the highlights:

 

 set in a time where usa and the soviet union are at a full-on war.

 the first part of the dream sees me running across an american battlefield, trying to avoid bullets, mines, bombs, missiles and just about every other type of munition.

 i saw a very large passenger jet, presumably american, get hit by a missle and then crash into the sea.  this jet was filled with olympic athletes.

 at this point, the dream becomes more of a movie and i am delegated to observer status.

 a rag-tag group of americans decide that the only way to stop the soviet union is to infiltrate their country and kill their leader.  the group of americans consist of a female olympic judge, a 12-year-old girl and an older guy that looks like james earl jones.

 this group has to train to be able to infiltrate the country.  instead of learning military techniques, they learn how to train water snakes.

 i don't remember how, but all of a sudden the entire group is in the heart of the soviet union.  the unnamed leader is hiding out in a rural town in a boarding house.

 the little girl sneaks upstairs, undetected, to find the leader sleeping amongst 15 other people from the town. the girl places a rag of some sort of chemical over the leaders mouth, knocking him out.  instead of just killing him, the girl saws off his head with a dull machete and puts it into a burlap bag.  no one has yet noticed anything has happened.  she sneaks downstairs and runs outside.

 just as she joins the rest of her group hiding behind a bush outside, there is a sound much like the sharpening of a machete.  from an open window upstairs, the now-dead body of the leader with a ghostly head starts to appear in the window.  at first, it's safe to assume he is about to brandish a machete when instead he pulls out a .50 cal machine gun (the type that is normally truck mounted).  before he can fire, the james earl jones character grabs a gun from the ground and sprays the leader with bullets.

 the end."

""final fight"" still seems decent, and thankfully shows that not  all  of those precious quarters were wasted.  ahh, to be back in the k-mart arcade playing ""altered beast"" and ""time warriors""...  sunday, i sat around some more.  while everyone else was watching fireworks, i was sitting through ""fahrenheit 9-11"".  in a nutshell: i loved the first ten minutes, including the minimalist title sequence, and the eerie handling of 9-11.  moore's naked contempt for g.w. is palatable when it's merely being insinuated.  it's less so when he refers to g.h.w. bush as g.w.'s ""daddy""... but then i guess that's what political discourse has become in this country.  as with ""bowling for columbine"", moore's film is most effective when read at arm's length.  many of his facts are incorrect, and the things he infers can be completely unfair, but some of the broader strokes (such as our cozy relationship with saudi arabia, or the increased fear-mongering of the media in the past few years) invite discussion, which is probably a good thing.  wild man dan nordquist has invited me to post on his new  urllink video game blog .  see you there."

 thanks to shari's deft handling of getting the genkai 1 alliance going on friday/saturday, our genkai experience was only mildly horrible instead of as excruciatingly horrible as it could have been.   
 
 on friday, starting out with an alliance of 10 people that would eventually grow to 12 and then shrink back to five as the night went on, we managed to obtain 7/8 of the needed exoray molds in a mere 5 hours.  during this time we  somehow  (read: i blame everything on dynastey)  managed to aggro nearly everything in the nest at least once, and in the case of water elementals - two or three times. 
 
 saturday turned out better. on our trek to eldeime dyn only managed to aggro half of the mobs in the glacier -- a personal best!  even with a smaller group than the night before, we were still able to dispatch anything that came our way.  in a mere four hours we were rewarded with 4/8 papyrus and only one death and level down.  it was just shari, so it wasn't so bad. :)
