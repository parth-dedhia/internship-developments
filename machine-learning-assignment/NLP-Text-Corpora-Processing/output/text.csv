       The history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan.   Seitan (say-TAHN) is made from gluten. Gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic. Known as Seitan in Japan, as kofu in China, and as ""wheat meat"" and ""gluten"" here in the U.S., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute. It has been eaten in China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the Middle East for thousands of years. Gluten is often referred to in Chinese restaurants as ""Buddha food"", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian Buddhist monks as a meat substitute. It is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition.   As a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of B vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. A 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat. The same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats. As recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement.   Another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this. Most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce). If you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon). Moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes.   Many vegetarians' first experience with eating gluten is at Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants, where it's called ""mock duck"", ""mock chicken"", etc. When it's sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it's called Seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word ""gluten"" lacks consumer appeal. It stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too ""meaty."" However, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, Wheat Meat"" is growing in popularity.   Seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency. The dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop. Next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran. What is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu. When raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it's called ""seitan"".   It is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat. It can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried. Each version yields a different texture. Oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering. Baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan. Pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture. Fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well.    - Written by Alyx Sandborg, Copyright 2002 by PageWise, Inc

      Westwood has  lost weight by eating high protein meat substitutes  and has enjoyed such a lift from his better diet and fitness that he is being sponsored by a well-known meat substitute company ( urlLink Quorn ) for two years. After ending three years in the wilderness since his heady 2000 with two wins last year, Westwood, lying 64th in Europe and with only moderate performances on the U.S. Tour, is aiming to prove he really is back.  'I saw the benefits Darren was getting and I've felt like I needed to do something for a long time,' said Clarke's management stablemate. 'The great thing is, I've lost all this weight and on the (Reuters) statistics I'm (driving) 10-15 yards longer.'

      Hosted by Kim O'Donnel washingtonpost.com Staff Writer Thursday, April 29, 2004; 12:00 PM  Released MAY 5, 2004  A graduate of Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, Kim spends much of her time in front of the stove or with her nose in a cookbook.   The transcript follows.   Editor's Note: Washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions.   ________________________________________________   Kim O'Donnel: Hello out there. It's been a while since our last get-together. For those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last Thursday on the month. Since we last discussed, I came across a fun piece on Yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: ""flexatarian."" I think that would aptly describe my eating habits. Interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. So, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. Onward...   _______________________   I'm a goin veggie huntin....: Kim!; Two questions: First, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? Second, what great things should I look for at the farmers market this saturday morning?    Kim O'Donnel: The nice people at Arlington Courthouse have been very patient with me as I've not gotten my act together on setting a date. It'll be sometime in May or June, probably June. Funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on WTOP this morning was all about my finds last weekend. Think green, kids. It's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!   _______________________   Frederick, Md.: I'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. However, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. Can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (My goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)   Kim O'Donnel: There is a vegetarian cooking school in New York City that has a good reputation. Name escapes me at the moment; it might be Natural Cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. Check out shawguides.com   _______________________   St. Paul, Minn.: My two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. I don't think he gets enough calcium. Any suggestions? And can you tell me how to make a smoothie? After I make one, how long can I leave it in the refrigerator?   Kim O'Donnel: Lentils are loaded with calcium. Spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: I prefer with yogurt, and to it, I add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. I don't add ice or juice because I like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. Doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim. Just got back from New Orleans and while I made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, I'd love to make my own. Any suggestions? I'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe?   Kim O'Donnel: I think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the Gimme Lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra!   _______________________   Prince Frederick, Md.: Can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of Sherpas in Tibet. Most of what I've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. I want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. I still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.   I can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet. But what really turned me off about meat was reading ""Fast Food Nation."" It revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. I recommend everyone read it, as well as ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair.   Kim O'Donnel: Prince,  Vegetarian cookbooks have come a LONG way from the days of co-ops and communes...There are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. Immediately what comes to mind are titles by Deborah Madison, Jeanne Lemlin and then there's Crescent Dragonwagon's ""Passionate Vegetarian"", loads of titles by Robin Robertson...and all of them are very contemporary.   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,   My husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. Any ideas as to what it is?  Thanks a bunch!   Kim O'Donnel: The green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. This is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. You can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, REALLY well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta...   _______________________   Virginia: Does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? I am looking for big pieces, not something that is ""ground."" I have tried a couple of things without much luck. Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Many looking for similar products like the taste of Quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got Quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?   _______________________   Anonymous: I have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk. They sell it at Whole Foods.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for chiming in...that's what I was thinking...   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.: For meatless jambalaya, I'd use tempeh, I like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. Some seitan might be good for texture also.   Kim O'Donnel: Ah, bueno. Thanks, Silver!   _______________________   Reston, Va.: I'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but I hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref. northern va)?   Kim O'Donnel: Yes, yes, yes!  Arlington Courthouse, on Saturday mornings.  Dupont Circle and Takoma Park, Sunday mornings.    _______________________   Veggie burger: I've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it. Can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? Not lentils, please (ewww...)   Kim O'Donnel: A few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. Since then, I made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. I did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but I gotta get you the details. I don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after I look through my papers at home...   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: We like to eat Morning Star Farms ""Chik Nuggets"" - they also come in patties. My son particularly likes to have this when friends who ""hate"" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something NOT chicken.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, Arlington.   _______________________   East Falls Church, Va.: Hi, Kim!   You mentioned last chat (Tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. I presume you peel it first, but I, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).   Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Hey EFC,  Yeah, I cut off what I need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m&p. Works really well, and no, you do get what you need.   _______________________   Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.: For your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school . . . yes, it's called the Natural  Gourmet Cookery School  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in New York City.  They also do dinners open to the public on most  Friday evenings. Sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.   Kim O'Donnel: Hey, thanks for following up!   _______________________   New York, N.Y.: Kim,   I need fruit help. I feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right? What should I look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? I'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when I all really want is to stop at Kripsy Kreme!;   Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: It IS a tough time for fruit. I was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. Soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. Mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi...   _______________________   Re: Low Fat Veggie Cookbook: Moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes MANY more things than what sherpas would eat. It has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for reminding me...my Moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use.   _______________________   For Reston looking for farmers market in NoVa:: The Falls Church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings   Kim O'Donnel: Great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader.   _______________________   Alexandria, Va.: Hi Kim!   When you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the Alexandria Farmers' Market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. It's open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every Saturday.   Kim O'Donnel: Very glad that you've reminded me, Alexandria.   _______________________   Virginia: I am so excited, I just have to share. For years, I have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in Indian restaurants, but the ones I made were never as good. I finally found the secret: rosewater. You only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. Also, the frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe's make lassi-making very easy, and I find the quality to be very good. I have been drinking them every day this week!   Kim O'Donnel: Funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some Indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing.   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.: Hi Kim -  I have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... I've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy.   I'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it. Do you have any ideas?   Love your chats - you rock!   Kim O'Donnel: Squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, Silver. Some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. Sounds nice.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, I want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? Also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? Would I cook the tofu at all before adding it in? I'm not sure where to start...   Thanks!!   Kim O'Donnel: Do you want to do coconut milk curry? Talk to me.   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim,  White bean bruschetta - I tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients - & I  bought the wrong kind of beans. Here's  what I came up with so far - what am I  missing (or how can I vary it)?   tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil   Kim O'Donnel: The beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in Italy, bruschetta are among the many ""salatini"" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. You can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt. Lemon zest is great. Rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry...   _______________________   Fairfax, Va: Kim,   My wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and I'm a happy meat eater. I'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but I'd like to do it on the grill. What can I cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (And how do I do it)?   Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: You can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. Brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. Serve over rice. You, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,  Speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on Thursdays in Penn Quarter (I think it was on 7th and E maybe?) Is it coming back? Do you know when? It was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...  Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Yes, it is. Starting next Thursday, May 6, from 3 to 7.   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.: Hello-  Do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? Preferably in MD. THanks   Kim O'Donnel: Weekend section usually does an annual list which I'm betting will come out next month. Anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?   _______________________   Rockville, Md.: My favorite Italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. In making this at home would you recommend the ""plain old salted"" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...   Kim O'Donnel: Plain, unsalted. You got it...   _______________________   Vegetarian Pigs in a Blanket: Does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? I am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: I'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hey Kim, A quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? I'm trying to cut back on sugar, so I'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. Can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil...   _______________________   soy bechamel?: Any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? There's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the March Cooking Light that I'd like to modify. Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work. I don't know for sure. My copy of ""Dairy-Free Cooking"" offers some ""cream sauce"" ideas...so why not??   _______________________   Vege in Fairfax, Va.: To the question about Paneer from the What's cooking chat. One can drain it in Cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. Keep in a cold place overnite. Remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.  Actually Mango lassi is not very common in India. Lassi is usually salty. I just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. Yummy  Try cardamon in your Mango lassi for the extra zing!   Kim O'Donnel: Thanks, Fairfax...great tidbits...I'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis...   _______________________   St. Louis, Mo.: Another cookbook suggestion: I started out veggie with the ""Horn of the Moon"" cookbook by Ginny Callan. Many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. A follow-up book, ""Beyond the Moon,"" includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (Carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) Worth a look.   Kim O'Donnel: Not familiar with this one, St. Lou. Thanks for the tidbit...   _______________________   Suitland, Md.: Does anyone know of a good Soy Cheese brand? Something that actually tastes like cheese? I am looking for a block that I can grate.   Thanks!!   Kim O'Donnel: Who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim!; I have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. I have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. I was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? Thanks!;   Kim O'Donnel: Blanching them does help bring them along, Washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea....   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.: Hello Kim-  I have an eggplant question for you. I generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that I really, really love it. I know it is simple but can't figure it out. I usually have it as antipasto in Italian restaurants or when I was in Italy. It is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. I don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. Can you help me? Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, Bethesda. Was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? Do tell...   _______________________   Boston, Mass.: Hi Kim,   What can I do with Broccoli besides steam it?  Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: I like roasting it, at 500 degrees. But first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. It's a great treat!   _______________________   Indian Head, Md.: Hi Kim! My new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. I am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.   They are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!   J   Kim O'Donnel: Let's see...I'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: My special someone has a birthday coming up and I wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. Do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that I could try and use?   Kim O'Donnel: Spectacular and vegetarian...I'm thinking of a curry. I've got an interesting idea for a Thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but I think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest...   _______________________   Oxford, Miss: I'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but I'm getting bored with my recipe. Do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?   Kim O'Donnel: Do you make a sofrito for your r& b? You know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...I'd also add a chopped fresh chile...   _______________________   Reston, Va.: Good morning Kim. Still struggling with the white sweet potatos. Any ideas?   Thanks!   Kim O'Donnel: Not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...I'd roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest...   _______________________   Herndon, Va.: Oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my  marinate recall has lapsed  please advise with some great basics for  marinating - I'm specifically thinking of the  little mushrooms and zucchini I bought  yesterday for BBQ skewers, but a good  marinate could work on most foods...   also, any hints on grilling veg on  skewers?  thanks in advance   Kim O'Donnel: Salt really well. Use a brush. Olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size...   _______________________   Reston, VA: Hooray for the mention of the Alexandria farmers'  market. My great-grandfather sold there every  Saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad  tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early  to go to market. There are also lots of stories about  my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that  were packed on Friday...   Kim O'Donnel: Nice story, Reston. Thanks for the memories...   _______________________   Re: strawberry picking: Butler's Orchard, in Germantown (MD). You can call their phone line to find out what's available when.   Kim O'Donnel: Excellent!   _______________________   Laurel, MD: Chiming in:   Rice and beans: I've been planning a reverse black beans  and white rice using white beans and some of the black  rice, seasoned with a South-east Asian theme.   Kim O'Donnel: Ooh...I like that...   _______________________   Dallas, Texas - Arugala: Hi Kim.  Wanted to share a great sauce recipe. I sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions. Let it all cook together till the sauce thickens. I served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta. At the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe. Very healthy and delicious. And with all the flavors, you won't miss the meat.   ~Chef in training   Kim O'Donnel: Very nice indeed, Dallas. Keep sending reports of your experiments!   _______________________   Washington, DC: This may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans? I.E. does the can say ""White Beans"" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? Thanks for the insight.   Kim O'Donnel: White beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and Great Northern beans. They are interchangeable.   _______________________   Adams Morgan: How does one make a white bean spread?   Kim O'Donnel: A can of drained white beans. Whiz in a food processor. Olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. Taste. Lemon zest is nice, too. Taste. Add more seasoning if needed. Taste for smoothness, too. You're good to go.   _______________________   Arlington, VA: Hi,   I hope you can help me. I have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. Ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. The only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if I grind up veggies inside dumplings. I tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in Fear Factor eating worms. I think it's a texture thing. Do you have any suggestions?   Kim O'Donnel: Take her to the farm market this weekend. Introduce her to a farmer. Let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. Obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. Let me know how it goes...   _______________________   Kim O'Donnel: Out of time, folks. Thanks for all the good stuff. Take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! The air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! Promise to be back for end of May, and in meatime, join me for the regular Tuesday free for all..Best to you.   _______________________    Â© 2004 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive

      By JESSICA RAE PATTON, May 7 2004  I recently spent the weekend in Chicago, the city of encased meat. Just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there.  At Hot Doug's, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks.  But there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend Emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro. Because the fact is, although I'm a vegan, I'm a fool for fake meat. Or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside French fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands. These food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine. But I guess because Chicago's a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as Studs Terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions. I, for one, thank Doug and his colleagues for this. That was one damn good dog. Char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll.  I returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that I might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts. I dragged my boyfriend, Art, along to taste-test the real ones.  I f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu. At the original Swanky Frank's, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic I-95 on-ramp, the owner, Bob, snorted, ""That would be sacrilegious.""  ""But I was in Chicago, and--""  ""This isn't Chicago, is it?"" He said and walked away. Was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general? Maybe I was naÃ¯ve to the subversive nature of soy protein. And here I just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub.  I sat on a rickety stool and ordered French fries and blathered on about writing a food review. The fry cook, who looked like Billy Bob Thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can't write a food review if all you eat is French fries. These guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down. Their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in.  In all fairness, our server at the swankier of the Swankies, in Westport, was super-friendly. (Let's consider the first location Skanky Frank's, as to not confuse the two.) She smiled and everything. The place also looked like it had been intimate with both a paintbrush and a sponge in recent memory. Art highly approved of the deep-fried technique. ""It makes the texture crackly, not snappy.""  ""Snappy?""  ""Yeah, some hot dogs are snappy. The skin won't give right away when you bite it, then it snaps.""  He also liked that the raw onions were self-serve. For the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions. ""The bacon's under the dog, where it should be,"" he noted.  The French fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through. We liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box.  Dog: $2.90, Fries: $2.25   â¢ â¢ â¢    Rawley's Drive-In 1886 Post Rd., Fairfield, 259-9023  Rawleys' dÃ©cor makes Skanky Frank's look positively posh. The wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin. Two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together.  ""So. Would you ever consider carrying a veggie dog, you think?""  ""NO WAY!"" The one working the grill yelled. ""People freak out if we change anything here. We had to repair those walls,"" he gestured to two white walls behind him, ""to meet health codes, and people flipped out. A veggie dog? They'd KILL us!""  They got every single thing about our order wrong--handed us someone else's food, gave Art the wrong drink, rang the order up incorrectly, made it ""for here"" instead of ""to go."" The more flustered they got, the more they messed up. I didn't mind a bit. It somehow went with the summer camp vibe, and I thought it was probably a fluke. They were extremely apologetic. ""It was SO busy a minute ago, we were SLAMMED,"" the one at the cash register explained.  The word ""Poop"" was engraved in huge letters right below the counter.  The cook pulled Art's dog from the fry basket, split it and threw it on the grill. ""It's deep-fried and grilled?"" I asked, because I couldn't believe it. It was like a heart attack on a bun.  After a couple investigative bites, Art reported that he actually preferred Swanky Frank's single dose of grease, though the Rawley's dog also passed the crackly texture test, the bun was fresh and well-toasted and there was a generous amount of bacon draped over the dog.  I was still trying to interpret ""snappy."" ""Is it that feeling of breaking the seal with your teeth?"" I asked.  ""Exactly,"" he said.  ""I like that,"" I said.  ""That's the thing. It's so hard to judge hot dogs, because they're such a historical food in a person's life."" He gestured philosophically with his dog. ""People are fanatical about these. This is the perfect hot dog if it's what you grew up with.""  No one could get nostalgic about the fries, however, which were of the frozen, crinkle-cut variety, mealy and barely browned.  Dog: $2.40, Fries: $1.90   â¢ â¢ â¢    Super Duper Weenie 306 Black Rock Turnpike,Fairfield, 334-DOGS  I admit I was biased in favor of Super Duper Weenie to begin with for its name. And if I had to eat off any of the linoleum-checked floors, this would be the one. By now I was resigned that there were no take-out veggie dogs in my near future... when I spotted its cousin on the menu.  ""How long have you carried veggie burgers for?"" I asked the cashier, who turned out to be one of the owners, Lorin.  ""Since we opened,"" he said.  ""But you don't have a veggie dog?""  ""Veggie dog? I can't say we've ever considered it."" He appeared to actually be contemplating the concept.  ""Would you consider it?""  ""I don't think they'd sell.""  ""Do the veggie burgers sell?""  ""Yeah.""  ""So why wouldn't a veggie dog?""  ""We're a greasy hot dog place.""  ""You could just try it out.""  ""We have tuna...""  ""Please?""  ""I'll think about it. We've honestly never thought of it before.""  Art surveyed his super duper dog. Plentiful onions, two fat strips of bacon. But I could tell his assessment by the face he made when biting down. Snappy. He liked the flavor of the meat, if not the texture, but Swanky Frank's was his personal overall favorite dog of the day, no question.  We agreed the fries were stellar--the best of the bunch by far. Lots of skin, whittled-thin shapes, perfectly crisp with downy insides. Lorin gave the batch a generous shake of pepper as well as salt. Pepper on French fries! Kind of nouveau cuisine for a former hot dog truck, don't you think? I just know an animal-free frank is next...  Dog: $2.70 Fries: $2.25  Copyright Â© 2004, Fairfield County Weekly

      Here is a little introduction to a few of them     Soya : Soya is a good source of protein and low fat. Can be used to produce milk, dairy replacements products, as well as to replace the texture and bulk of meat, usually in the form of textured vegetable protein. Is usually the basis for many meat substitutes.     Tofu  : Manufactured by a process similar to cheese making, but from soya milk. Very good source of protein, calcium and low fat.  Able to take on flavours well â great for marinating. Can be used for stirâfries, kebabs, salads and just about anything savoury. Tofu also is available in a silken form which is used for desserts, sauces or flans.     Quorn : Not made from soya but is a mycoprotein. Made from the fermentation of a fungus, mixed with egg white. Usually found as chunks, mince, fillets, burgers or sausages.

						   Outside North Ridge Hospital, the one that I know all the shortcuts to, I sit waiting for Triple A after hand holding in room 426 this time.  My grandmother is in again for rehydration. This time it's been 8 days. Today was by far the hardest. I decided to reach across and hold her hand bruised, swollen, arthritis with gout, not really a hand anymore.  Years of sewing trusses, hunched over, and for low pay.  I suspect she won't be around much longer. I think she has decided to let go. After all, there is nothing left here for her but more pain and the missing husband of 53 years, now dead 13 months.  The past 6 have been reasonable considering her coherence is so limited but today she was there. I saw in her eyes the same Grandmother who played games with me all summer long, put on plays, treated me like sugar on top of strawberries and now, me, child of 30 at her bedside; shriveled old woman the years were not kind to, wanting death knowing too full well now in my reaching out was saying to her from all of us for the first time the last time, you are forgiven.

There is no heavenly father and the one that shows up is years too late,  having forgotten the purpose of his labors, and no rest on the seventh day.

						    Fort Lauderdale   Not ready to go back just yet; the stillness,  outside cool air; a smoke on the patio; the cats asleep peaceful vibe.  Dreaming of my Virgo man, who has not yet shown himself to me.  Maybe he is waiting inside a coffeehouse books on table, notepad caputuring the spill;  or traveling the world, taking notes.  The breeze through the window, South Florida autumn, brings the first clear air of seasons through my screen.  Soft cloth to the outside glass, let the sun shine warm this room.  Curtains back, parrots in the sky, another cafe con leche, por favor.

						    DETACHMENT   My mother was right. The bone isn't stronger at the place of the break.  I remember this as I listen for the sound of your car turning back.  I have been listening for for 13 years  and you never come.  This time is no different. Your goodbye leaves me  scattered pieces this heart I mended, I tended so carefully these past four months with papers signed.  And tears come like air and sobs are hard like the sprinter's gasp and I find no peace, no deep waters under this shaken surface.  So alone, and you refuse my love again and again.  I know you don't love me. I felt it for six years, the unsurmountable task of communication.  We could find no network that could bring us together, no cables long enough or strong enough to channel the feelings.  And again and again I wait to hear what you can not say.  Maybe you think in your silence you do not hurt my feelings  as much as if I were to hear the truth.  Why is it like this between us?  You are the only man  whose love I have ever  wanted to have.  Time means nothing if it can still hurt just as much now.

						    THE LAST WORD   Even as I reach my door, the drama of you continues; train whistle blow outside my window; and I cried out as we raced to catch the 5:40.  ""Why does this have to be so dramatic?"" and he said,  ""Heather, you wouldn't have it any other way.""

I will not be latched in any man's cage. There is no combination to my love or lock to cut off.  I guard and protect my palace with curiosity, having learned the  art of questioning the witness, vicarious observation,  eating the emotions, dipping my bread and licking my fingers clean.  There is such a thing as too close and easy to spot amindst the blackness of eyelid curtains drawn.  Ignite into flame, sparks of wheels braking and every inside awakening.  This is the one I write for you inside my shallow cave of doubt and webs extending time across my space and death at every doorframe.  Damn you, the water that drowns itself, the air that suffocates, the fire leaving ash.  This earth can not bear these burdens nor count the weight of boxes shackled to ankles because you were afraid.  Step up and demand your rightful place. Empty the barrels of regret and shame. Throw the has been into the wind.  You have never been who you are right now.  And if I stamp my feet, and if I scream, then maybe you will leave me alone,  where I want to be, stepping aside.  And you will leave me Sorry China and all your prophesies fulfilled at last.  And I will tell my story into nothingness and remember nothing.  I will gesso over the canvas, press the delete button, and move on,  because that is what I do well.  And if I think it hurts for just a moment, I will blame the moon.  And if you think truth is known when it is named, you are missing the picture.  There is no truth, just images from electrons that flash and burn oblivion soup.

						    WHEN YOU LEARNED OF MY NAME   10 years ago was me to this place and nothing mattered much but that I could drink and the liquor store so close to my house and Food Lion for beer.  Still I wrote with feriocious intensity; love lost and forlorn of fantasies never formed.  And memories too; the drunken pounding of fingers to the keyboard on my new color screen computer.  I can remember sending you the poems though I can't remember which ones they were or what you might have known when you learned of my name.  I was anybody else at the time and you didn't know about all of the wine or how I came to men or who was why I am.  And I didn't know you were someone real housed in a castle of empties casting your net onto the page from the Dead Man's chair.  Conversations ensued we can not even remember, memory not being too important as the holy now and even now that is so.  There is no time and yet enough time, all of the world's time and no roles or expectations to grow one's hair long or shave off a beard.  Who we are now and what has been heard when nothing was said,  but still I wonder does he know and I hear him in my mind saying yes a thousand times I am saying nothing so loud, and even covering my smile poker faced as the dream is coming forward and the painting of the moon is mine and that school and that park and that is exactly yes and all the ashes in my car or the bowl of vomit left two days now at the foot of the table is nothing compared to nothing compared to nothing compared to.

						    CONFIDENCE   I am water. I am earth. My parents were fire and air.  I was pulled from the womb unwilling to face the birth canal when another option was possible.  It is always possible.  I come to you now on the verge of discovery. My sails are flowing and I am confident of this wind and this salt air, the canvas blowing filling with colors.  This confidence is like a gift and I appreciate and I endure;  weaving the strands into patterns into make believe and real and something warm to wear.  Life came to me  in summer and footy pajamas.  The fourth generation, baby Polish princess at the top of the aluminum siding castle.  There was a picnic table in the back yard. And my mother was air could she make them like her more by liking me enough.  And my father was fire over books and bad kitchen lighting to hook a career out of this place where he too was born.  We fled to the desert when I was three leaving snows behind and the oven my grandmother used to burn her children's hands with when they were bad.  A new set of grandparents welcomed me like a second birth and there was a kitten for a friend, soon a pool, and a million books of witches and goblins and girls who knew magic.  My mother stayed inside with romance novels and melon ballers and sometimes gin and vermouth but always perfect; coming outside with cut up vegetables and hours working to please the palette of my Dad. She knew her role. She was air. She passed through.  And when I was good I was very very good and when I was bad I was horid.  Sweat pulled off in the dry heat like mirage as I waited for my father to get home to punish me for something done again to my mother.  He was fire. She was air and I was earth and water.  The tension and terror of the beating and having to do whatever she said or else.  This much I remember and nothing more will come to this page today.  I am lifted from the story in a giant helium balloon and carried up up up to the stars and evening night as the sunset hits camelback mountain and saguaros turn purple with goodnight.

						    STAND BY   Disillusioned I soar, a bird who has clipped her own wings, finding at last that I have no fire to offer the universe; it was yours all along.  Alone now I hide, with my gifts unwrapped, bowless, as if the universe cared for another utopian dream, a direction of love pointed to with an open heart by a mute.  And if my tears could turn this dry earth to mud, and if my soil could change the world, then throw me to the flame and let my ashes proof the clay between your hands.  I am nothing. I am no one, at last the liquid poured into sieve of self and gone.  What good is the desire to serve when desire only cuts and divides both halves.  There are pieces of me I will leave behind here, leaving my dreams unfulfilled, my faith in myself crushed by a fist, rumpled into a ball and tossed with so much other rubbish.  So this I will tell you when your voice is back, that I have failed, that I have faltered, that I have gazed into the mirror and reflected none of what you have seen, vision pissed into balloons and cast into the sea.  I am a whimper. I am a moth not a dragon, weak, withdrawn, to retreat to the cage of my fingers, to lock the door without a key.  And in the end, if one will come, I will remember nights without sleep, the weight of my passion, the pounding belief at my door that knocked and knocked and knew no peace.  My back was strong and inside much light, but thought orbits like stars, like earth around sun, the moon which never came, and no certainty as I watched my picture fade.  I knew at any time even now, I could stand, make a decision, and be strong again, bone and blood, but feelings like magnets hold me to this chair, and it is more true not to move now.  Like faucets, like data through cables and I divert my eyes from danger like God's house or salvation, rather inside believing failure when uncertain success may come.  I resign my position of mood director.  I relinquish my smile at strangers, my mind the master, brandishing the whip at every indescretion or indecisive move. It hangs in my solar plexus like indigestion.  I have squandered my power. I have trusted that I could be you and made promises I can not keep.  I have buried myself with a toy shovel and lost my place and lost my way.  I spin and spin to gather speed, bursts of  dull light, explosions of average, my ego kicks and screams echoing down the well.  I will forgive no one, not myself, nor you, nor all of those gardners planting hope and despair.  Not even weeds could sprout through baked desert cracks in my soul.  Even the cactus gave up on rain and shriveled to a stick, thorns still sharp.  Nothing to guess at now, reality unveiled, my pathetic escape plans scrawled over  This is my weakness. Look at the man behind the curtain now, gaze upon her face.  I will ask none of you for help or hinderance, you have suckled me on lies foolish needy trusing lips to nipple, and the dead weight  of my aspirations, and the bullshit faith in my abilities, and the tears that well up now,  unable to keep it together  even for the hour and a half plane ride home.

The magic you convey is possible in the moment, every moment.  I am singing in these words. I am dancing the steps painted on the sidewalk.  Take my arm in yours. I am willing.

						    CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE   Silence starting and already I imagine trips to the mailbox, but what the fuck, and why  am I missing something here that has kept my mouth shut tight like duct tape over lips against a terrorist threat.  Light another. Smoke another.  Get this out of my head and down where I can understand nothing better than big talk from someone else,  while I sit and observe, while I sit and perceive.  I am whipped into submission by my reflection.  My tawdry alter ego, the no show, readied for my finale as a failure and no head for numbers, so what will become of me...  I have three days left before I can be myself again and nobody will be there on the other side to hear it.  What have I done and why should I care if I don't don't care when I'm my own nurse writing prescriptions, before the Third Bardo.  For all the promises made to send to me, now will the letters come?  What do you care and why should you care when I am just another stranger or reminder that you have heard everything before and probably said much better.  Is that jealousy?  I have nothing to offer but breath and that which comes natural to dissipate every energy landing here.  Doubt, fear, shame.  This is nothing to contribute and I can't get by on my tits, my looks faded at 5 years old and I'm lucky to hear cute anymore.  Responsible, dependable me.  Why can't I just be alone where no shadows play across the walls I don't cast myself.  Why can't I just be alone and not hear your voice or wonder and wait by the mailbox for something not coming out here now to tell me the truth.  4:05 AM Friday, June 27, 2003

						    HOW DARK   This dramatic ending was courtesy of T-Mobile.  Sixty seconds on Bradley's phone explained nothing.  I am a greyhound let loose after the rabbit, carting your newest disciple behind me.  Thoughts of this and who I am spark, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Back at home, wondering who this father he thinks you are is, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Pieces fly and the jig saw changes the shape on the way down.  I am powerless watching this story play out in not the way I feel.  And I question every question I questioned and the answers that sound different the second time rewound, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  The line to you is cut and words can only get me into trouble later or sooner if I send them.  This is not my half. This is not my whole. This is not my job, my problem, my passion, my possession.  I am lightning. Look at the path.  I am the moon reflected in a pail. Look up.  All my words and all my sorrows have already been taken, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Go ahead and choose another title for this  meaning less.  It will take longer to explain the sound of my own voice this time.  2:55 AM Friday, June 27, 2003

Nobody said anything.  Isn't now too late to raise my hand for air?  This is not the song I expected to be playing for you this month.  This is not the book I wanted to read when I finally let go.

						    BETWEEN THE NOTES   I remember talking with you at the table, you in your assigned place, and me in mine, even though the parents were gone.  You told me I was too young to think about things like the meaning of life,  or what my purpose here  would be.  You are supposed to be out having fun, you told me, and I would ask you  what if thinking about these things was my idea of fun.

This summer equinox knocks to find me barely awake at its passing and  cursing the light that won't heal another's suffering.  It has rained all day and you tell me 600 persons were evacuated in the flooding when we talk.  There are no fire flies this far into the city anyway and even if the grasses were dry the crickets would not grind any softer.  I have been promised that the meaning of life is time by an uncle I got drunk a dozen Christmasses ago.  I immerse myself in it like a bath of gravy and barely float.  I shovel the walk of it every morning when I wake and notice its passing when the last quarter moon rises behind the clouds.  Decades too young to retire from life, I give up anyway.  I stand accused of dreaming of a world too good  to be real.  Evidence is presented without a spell check in great abundance for the good of the masses.  They tell me their fears and wish me well enough alone, trapped in prisons of their own regret.  I stand inside my cell tonight because I know my way around here even in the dark.

The past ruffles its feathers against  the girl with a lifetime (still short) of boxes filled with collections of what  can not be bought.  Dreams may come, and she may call names  out into the darkness like memory cares enough to answer her at all.  She asks if true love is as real as stars or bright  planetary nebulae, a fuel that burns to tell us something  about our own origins.  All remembered at once, it is sudden as  dissapoint ment  and the gravity of a single misplaced thought, found still searching for the pea under her matress.

In only a few moments, the time for dinner will have passed, all movies will have already begun, and all of your friends will be in the thick of their plans for the night.  You may believe in the urgency of the greater cause the company has instilled in you, and the idea  of your place in this world from which there is no  clocking out.  So wake at dawn to work but know in the end it is nothing.  The time will come where death  will rock your boat, the loss of a loved one  leaving an anchor deep under your waves, and you will wonder where all those sunsets went and why you were not there to hold her hand at starlight.  You will find that all those trips for work meant nothing, are not even remembered, and even the money left behind is too weak to keep you floating.  Begin to tread now, and gather your strength. Pick up your sail and work with the wind this time, for love is more than greed will ever buy.  You will never be important enough or have enough proof of your worth through any job or any title.  It is quicksand to your self and no matter how much it eats of your soul it will never be full.  Forgive yourself the times you made others do your work so you could ride the corporate coaster.  Forgive yourself the times you couldn't be there because you thought you were too important.  Forgive yourself now for truth does not come easy and without a lesson.  There are many oceans ahead of you to call your home now that you know.

						    AFTER A DAY AT HOSPICE   How slowly these stages pass, how gradual a slope, and we too are learning while the summer passes by without our concern.  The days lengthen and stretch beyond us while we too  are blanketed by the nurses in kindness and patience.  With Grandma there are moments where she lets me know  with the grip of her hand, she is still here.  Sometimes there is a smile, beautiful beyond skies.  There have been days too where she has comforted me when weak,  my tears falling unashamed by my love for this woman who has given me so much acceptance and concern, a gentle respect for simple truths.  I remember weeks ago, hot from the walk to the Hospice house, I came to her and took her hands in mine. With silence she drew them  to her lips  to blow them cool.  This is love.  It is here I have learned tenderness. It is here I have learned care. These are my thoughts riding my bike home, thanking my legs, my heart, my health.  Home, I hesitate doing what would make me feel good because even the tension in my  shoulders,  neck,  face, reminds me that  you are still here. There is so little time now  for other souvenirs; memories made, forgiveness granted,  and night passes on to another day of lessons and farewells.

You came to my door with words I long to hear, having scripted them so meticulously, missing nothing.  We spoke from the heart and dreamed in color, filling the skies, traveling through deserts and on high mountain roads.  I gave you the resume of my heart, objective clear, and you responded in delight.  Pity you were not there to experience any of it.  Why must love be for another when it can not be against?

There have been crueler summers, the time to let my heart out to play, learning there is beauty too in suffering.  I am more than less I was as dogs bark and the room is still save the ceiling fan having it's own gentle caress on my shoulders.

Keep to yourself.  Keep your hands in the car at all times.  Rhetoric and righteousness from too shaky a foundation, is roughness  and  sand castles.

						    ON PURPOSE   In times of fear, we all fall back on what we think we know to be our strengths when our weakness  makes us more human.  In a robot vision of life, in step with the crowd or with those breaking free, all of the indecisions are abandoned for better distractions.  In the microwaveable vision of life, time is saved by not wondering purpose or planning for trips not yet taken;  and everyone has answers they are willing to share.  The meaning of life is waiting for you at the convenience store up the street, from the man you see everyday who may not even know your name or the brand you buy;  and everyone has answers they refuse to speak of.  They have a lot to do with that (w)hole you are trying so hard to fill.  So...  Dance to another man's beat.  Sing the lyrics you didn't write.  Stare into the photo you didn't take.  Creativity is for what practical purpose anyway or should that question anchor  elsewhere.  Creativity is for what conversation going on under the surface, projecting as anger or disagreement, or a million things not talked about because there is one thing still undiscussed.  What if you were the answer?  What if you were the center?  Commitment is  even harder to make to ones self than  to another when stubbornly, the dream refuses to let go when the alarm clock goes off, and  still nothing to do on purpose.

						    I COME TO THE DESERT   I come to the desert  to find my past, reconnect with roots  buried in hard soil played on in childhood, Creosote smells foretelling distant rain the heat evaporates before landing.  I come to the desert  to find my past, branches of my heart dried like cactus bones, asking acceptance from this earth or these Indian eyes, or these Mexican smiles, who glance over me like forgiveness is all I can earn here under this white skin.  White like klan robes, white like eyes opened wide, white like lies told for victories never won in justice.  I come to the desert  to find my past at the National Atomic Museum, and learn about Nobel scientists, skin mushroom cloud white like mine, and I am demanding to know the half-life of truth.  I come to the desert  to find my past at the Pueblo museum in plaques defining 19 tribes, each with a paragraph describing their survival among the greed of conquerors using God as a weapon with skin white like mine.  I come to the desert to find my people at the museum  of Hate and Intolerance, but the gates are closed, guarded by silent kachinas skin bright and bold, not white like mine.  I come to the desert  to find my purpose at a poetry reading, revealing injustices and lost identities boiled down in this melting pot and listen  as though in the truth  of another, some answer may be found, but in an instant am shattered when a note scrawled on napkin is passed to me, ""This is not Starbuck's,"" a message for skin white like mine.  I come to the desert  to find my homeland  for I am removed  three generations from my name.  Perhaps it would be better to find my past in the Polish family who came to this United States to escape their torturers and build generations who could speak the language, who would not have to break backs  and cramp fingers in the tobacco fields, picking and sweating and laying leaves across wood to dry.  I am told these were my people, strangers to me, I was carried away to the desert when I was three. I was not told their stories until the summer Stasia took me to Chu Chu's to hear her memories of being in the Catholic concentration camp with her son Billy.  It was seven years  before they escaped, after the war was over,  but before liberation came.  I come to the desert because these stories do not truly belong to me, and I cannot find comfort in Chu Chu's words at the end of her tale, ""the Jews deserved it,"" her ancient face revealing eyes still unforgiving, betraying her frailty.  She was dead four years before I was told.  So I come to the desert, seeking community and culture only tasted at restaurants, licking my lips, the color on my body and deny my race, for I am not white, I am beige, beige like these desert sands, beige like these hard rock mountains.  I am beige in the sun.  I darken my skin in the shadows.  I stand alone, the last of my family line, the family who worked to give me the freedom  to buy a new history for myself among the madness of conquerors  enslavers liars murderers skin white  like the blisters  on my beige  heels, as I walk the desert to find  the sacred space to heal  my common humanity.

						    SOMEPLACE NEW AGAIN   I have had it with trolling for visions. The fish never bite and  I feel kind of funny pulling them up from the depths, considering the bends and all.  Though flashy colors and neon  have always caught my fancy, I realize there is more to pretty than that which remains when eyes  are closed.  Life is everywhere and I am.  Life is a kaleidoscope and I am up late feeling  the magic of dreams cast by my neighbors, and happiness  is found in simply being happy.  After all,  freedom isn't about freeing everyone else.  Let everyone find his own cloud monsters and  try to break them up with the power of his will alone.  Let everybody find her own set of flannel sheets to sleep comfortably at night.  We ride our bikes on parallel paths and I am  no more than just a few inches from you.  We climb our mountains with the same  weight of gravity tugging at our boots and I have no idea if this rope will hold.  The end result is never really an ending, but begin here just in case you think you have arrived someplace new again.

						    FROM FLAMES   If there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you.  I have reached to the stars, I have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them.  I dusted them off  and shined them up, as though God cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while.  What's not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step  to emerge from the abyss or  their leg to twitch  towards liberation.  I followed that map to oblivion time and time again  until I realized it was only  a representation.  I gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the Self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness.  Still the songs played on like trickling fingertips  on skin, light and playful and  wanting.  Still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness  of love regardless  of regard.  And night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or  time to arise from these flames like the Phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can.  Flap, flap, flap.

						    A STEP CLOSER TO STEPPING OFF   Voices raised like hands above heads, like waves  of fingers piano playing the air, accidental harmonies wanting  an end or just wanting  more.  The world spins out of synch, faster and hotter, like water spills like steam rises, like warm mud  or the soft underbellies of earth worms, making their way home while everybody goes about his business.  Drums beat to  mark the passage; the young girls dance while the boys look on, ying and yang pushed to a crescendo, cutting through the cage, as if victory is nothing more  than  a barrier breached again  and again.  For whose benefit are these metaphors and significances and coincidences?  For whose reward are these smiles and knowing winks and a nudge and a nudge and a nudge?  Wrong, wrong, wrong but will  we know right  when we see it?  Bad, bad, bad but will we know good when we see it?  The opposites define themselves into each other, merging and melting into the mud, and the earthworms go about their business, while everybody makes her way home.  The shouting turns to singing, turns to whispers, turns to laughter, turns to silence and then a rest between notes.

						    GERMINATION   The flowers you gave me are beginning  to open on my window sill; red rose taking on a new shape as the day progresses, overpowering the black-eyed susans.  As a gift to Spot, I bring the vase out to the patio where he sprawls  in catlike bliss on the current dining room table.  Stretching out, he purrs, rubbing his face into the leaves, losing his balance in wonder over the smells, and the leaves, and the tiny yellow petals reaching out from their branches  until a lizard catches his eye and it's just me here, remembering the bouquet held in your hands the night before  last.

						    TOO LATE   Not writing has become a metaphor for my life; instead of finished work behind me, ahead lies scraps of started interrupted thoughts, leading to what is unknown at present;  and I am behind myself, watching like talons underfoot tickle gashes, moving still under currents, thoughtless, running from something, giving up the dream again all too soon, again all too late to never finish the painting or poem.  What half am I trying so hard to whole with;  complete my self, male, female, animal;  and  planets spin and align, and astrologers interpret for the apathetic masses.  I shined too bright to be believable and when daybreak crashed against the bedroom wall, I was too hungry for the comfort and warmth of eyes and arms and legs to wrap around to tell the truth to even myself;  finding out too late, just as good as never finding out at all.

						    UNWRAPPED   Yesterday afternoon, we weeded  our first garden and  tilled the soil.  Now each  breath we take  is a greater symbol  than jumping  from a plane.  Your fingers touch mine and  the perfect fit of the palms together are more  than two breaths finding rhythm.  Each day more is unwrapped and contents  spill from morning, to afternoon, to evening.  I am below and above and beside it all, looking forward as if  it's the first time that direction  ever existed for me at all.

						    Cloud  Space   During the time when you have not  yet been to life or death;  everything everyone told you was important;  still  is.  Dreams are something to interpret to find your inner questions.  All purposes must have a goal at the end to cross and the sooner, the better.  You have not yet seen the bricks.  Cloud space on blue sky that should be white.  What is clear but the absence of something blocking.  Less to edit endlessly in the head and  the players still seeming to act from a different script.  Before the veil is lifted, before it is too indescribably beautiful to believe, innocent as the smooth skin on the side of a blade of grass, and you might even forget sometimes to look at the sunset or to remember when the moon will next be full.  Easier  to love in another while simply passing through the absence of clouds.

So many stories still untold and  a language left to learn and experiences to share;  while the Aries moon scatters her seeds into  the earth;  rises, wispy outline but still there  reflecting the sun.

						    BACK FROM NOWHERE   For weeks the wind has been howling backwards, blowing not a leaf but the sound and  the rumble inside is like a passing train.  The whistle never blows here in this town too far from major arteries; still there are tracks to cross back and forth and  harder  on a bike.  And this is home now.  I keep reminding myself how happy I am to have so much shade again.  I keep reminding myself how lucky I am  to have found someone who will live with me and my faults, little lines that open up the earth with a crack to fill with water.  And I keep reminding myself that it's okay to live without forever, it was only a word anyway.  Nights like these, the distant traffic sounds from Waldo Road are as comforting  as any waves reaching the shore but I still strain to hear a few planes or the helicopter landing on Broward General or searching for crime.  It's small town life and my space  is smaller too.  I'm still learning to share. It's so much easier for me to give.  You are asleep now, resting for work and dreams I do not understand.  Sometimes I wonder  if we weren't closer apart.

						    record scratches on the harmonica solo   Grieving myself into I box, I saw the sun through narrow slits, and clouds forming and the voices of all the arms around me drawing near, too near.  Each is in her own stage of dying down the mattered ways of age and giving up something for lent.  A thousand opportunities to grow and close and dance alone as one,  the dust rising from the road below his feet,  as thunder invites the rain forward in time.  Beasts and burdens, the bud opening again and again rather than giving up the flower pot.  A daisy in your hair or a paper airplane and still these questions slam dunk, rock the surface of the walls until the paint peels off like wallpaper and  someone is still not here.  No fortune left to chance as the craving of the ring moves like shadows on the movie theater wall, tickles the projectionist for a moment, then moves on.  And we are not the wind. And we are not the sail. And we are not the ship, the bow, the galley.  And we are not the passing hour, the memory of yesterday's tomorrow. muddled through, hands still clenching like a baby's fist.  Knowing who you are is all the more reason to fight the form, only half of what could be if letting go were that easy.  Merge me into your flesh and give me a reason to stay in the now longer than a blink.  Welcome me home, distracting the ending one more time.

This polarity is symbolic of individual needs [Leo] vs. collective ones [Aquarius]; attachment vs. detachment; individuality vs. groupidentity.

Give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and use the intensity of this lunation to focus on productive matters pertaining to your sign.  The Full Moon period signifies the peak of the waxing Moon energy... a great time to focus on spiritual, magical energies in order to direct them through meditation or personal ritual.

       Current Phase: Balsamic in Taurus  After the winnings are gathered up and the points are on the board, another game still goes on. Despite all accomplishments, larger questions always loom. After the second breaking point between Antithetical and Primary, we find those people who always take a deeper look. Sometimes they are driven to extremes by what they see. Sometimes they become the moral proprietors of their societies. In the end, it is only the freedom of the mind to understand.  The fourth quarter pushes beyond where social traditions (Instinct), gut feelings (Emotion) and mental brilliance (Intellect) can go. This is the place where all that experience is weighed in the balance of the big picture.  Balsamic phase is the best time for destroying weeds, pruning trees, and all preparation for the next cycle.  Sources:  urlLink PanPlanet    urlLink MoonPhase.net

       Current Phase: Last Quarter Moon in Gemini  The Last Quarter Moon brings a period of reflection and reevaluation. Internally, you are reorienting your priorities away from what has already transpired toward something new. Your focus now is on achieving the realization of a deeper meaning in your life. You may find yourself questioning your beliefs and values and discarding what no longer fits in order to make room for what you are discovering about yourself. Ultimately, this can bring about a complete turning away from something that was once important to you. You have the potential now to break through old limitations and release what no longer works for you. While you may not yet have a clear vision of where you're heading next, know that in tearing down old structures you're opening the door for new, exciting dreams to take root.

       Current Phase: First Quarter in Capricorn  The Moon is the First Quarter Moon when it separates from the Sun (after a New Moon) at an angle of 90 degrees (square). This square (which looks like a half moon in the sky) asks us to take care of the small things that grow into big uncomfortable things. If tensions come up, it's because you need to look at some part of a relationship or emotional structure in your daily life that just isn't working right and may need more thought. The First Quarter Moon is the first aspect since the New Moon that asks us to look at our newly devised plans from a distance that gives us a first glimpse of objectivity. This can create a sensitive issue or it can give you the resolve necessary to make improvements and keep going.    Capricorn Traits:  Capricornians are ambitious, resolute, cold minded, melancholic. Fatigue never makes them afraid, they work hard and are ready to sacrifice themselves, if necessary. They plan patiently and carefully all their objectives and the way to reach them. To achieve their results they are ready to do anything, without asking any help. They are reserved and introverted, but sometimes they live sudden moments of impulsiveness. Their main characteristics are shyness and insecurity which disappear when they realize of being loved and appreciated.  Sources:  urlLink ArtCharts    urlLink RealMagick

       Current Phase: Full Moon in Gemini  Begins Thursday 2:11 PM EST / Ends: Monday 7:19 AM EST  The Full Moon is the time when the Moon reflects the greatest amount of the Sun's light. The Earth is astronomically poised between the Sun and the Moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly, something the Gemini energy is adept at spotting. The opposing but equally-pulling gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon also reveals a tension within ourselves. The polarity of Gemini is Sagittarius.The polarity of a sign, is the sign that is opposite it in the zodiac. Since we are in the Sagittarius lunar cycle, that tension may be more pronounced.  By providing enough distance and light to give us an objective view of ourselves and how we relate to others, the Full Moon works to integrate and harmonize the contradictions in ourselves and others. This opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the Full Moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. There's literally an electrical energy build-up before a Full Moon and a release just after the peak. At the Full Moon, the seeds sown at the last New Moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we've sown. Working out the energy through the physical body can be grounding and centering.    About Gemini (Ruler Mercury):   The Astrological Symbol of Gemini is the Twins. Like their sign, the twins, they often have a dual nature and are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem, but they may also be fickle and restless.  Within the Zodiac, Gemini is opposite Sagittarius, the sign of philosophy. While Sagittarius tends to have one major interest that is studied deeply, Gemini people tend to have many different interests they study in less detail.  The element of Gemini is air. Air is vital to human survival. Without air, we would perish. Air is the power of movement; of freshening and of intellignce. Its the invisible and yet quite real mixture of gases that we breathe in every day. The three air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. In astrology, air stands for intellect, reason and communication. The quality of Gemini is mutable. The four mutable signs Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. In astrology, the mutable quality signifies versatility, adaptability, openness to change, and flexibility.   Gemini - Full Moon Meditation   from  urlLink The Labours of Hercules    «I recognize my other self and while this fades I grow and glow.» (May 21 - June 20)  This full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of Hercules from the Greek myth. The twelve tasks of Hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the Heart of God. As mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal. So we travel ""on the path until we become that path"", from Aries to Taurus and Gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to Pisces. In Gemini active work sets the standard tone. First comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in Aries and overcome desire in Taurus - the light of God everywhere.  In the third sign of the astrological year, Gemini, the Twins, Hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: Go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the Hesperides. Unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed. Perseverance holds the key.  The task appears to be easy and Hercules hurries into it. But the garden of the Hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins. Throughout the land Hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success. He is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way. From North he turns to South and wrestles with Antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness. Antaeus overcomes him at every point until Hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground. To the West Hercules now turns with new courage. He meets Busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone. Hercules loves and adores Busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year. Finally Hercules turns inwards and realises that ""Truth lies within yourself"". So he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before. A pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of Hercules, the one of Prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him. Hercules breaks the binding chain, frees Prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds. With much loss of time Hercules turns to the high mountains of the East, meeting Atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back. Hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain. He forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay. So he shoulders the burden of his brother unto his own back. But lo! the load rolls off and he stands free and likewise Atlas. From the loving hands of Atlas he gets the long awaited golden apples. Three sisters - Aegle, Erythea and Hesperis - await him with more apples declaring ""The Way to us is always marked by service. Deed of love are signposts on the Way"". The story ends with Hercules returning the apples to the three sisters ""for those who follow"".  The sign of Gemini consists of two pillars connected with a half-moon shaped arch: One pillar is open at the bottom, the other at the top. They symbolise the lower nature (body, feeling, mind) and the higher Self (atma-buddhi-manas). The pairs of opposites reveal themselves especially forceful in this sign - the higher Self striving upwards, the form aspect drawing downwards. Five tests Hercules has to pass before the fruits of Wisdom become his own: Sincerity, Alertness, Persistence, the Unfolding of Power for the search, and - finally - the selfless loving Service for others.  In Gemini, we learn to recognize the presence of the Higher Self. In the beginning one is aware of voice but does not hear, one sees or has a premonition of some danger but is blind until all assumptions and beliefs are transformed into knowledge and experience. Prometheus stands for the escape from the bondage of the mind, Atlas symbolizes the freedom and readiness to carry ""the Weight of the World"". Both, Prometheus and Atlas are witnesses on the way to our awareness of the higher Self. Loving compassion born of right thinking will lead us towards the goal. The keynote signifies that the lower nature (body, feelings and mind) - symbolized in the lower pillar of the sign - has to fade and become submerged to the higher Self which will then grow and glow.

       Current Phase: Full Moon in Leo   Sunday 3:52pm PST until Wednesday 11:26 PM PST when it moves into Libra   Leo has a real sense of specialness and perceives all it creates as gifts bestowed upon the rest of us in the name of love and life. Anything can happen under the influence of this most romantic of Moons. Leo loves to be the center of attention, so get out there and shine! For those of you who made commitments to life changes on the New Moon in Aquarius, this is the time to put those plans into action. You get to begin your new life with the self-confidence of a Leo Full Moon opposing Uranus in Aquarius, which represents the radical energy to throw out the old and bring in the new. The Venus and Chiron conjunction in Capricorn will give you added strength to achieve your goals; no matter how hard and long it takes. Remember that on a Full Moon, it helps to release your old behavior through ritual. This is a Full Moon of great inspiration and should not be wasted. If you have been suffering with creative blocks, the Leo Full Moon bestows the energy to break free of inertia and get into action. If it doesn't, you might reconsider your project or direction. Maybe it's just not the right one   This year the Leo Full Moon will be directly opposite Uranus in Aquarius. Some think that Aquarius and Leo are diametrically opposed to one another. But I find their synergistic and interdependent relationship unique among the signs. Aquarius demands radical change, which cannot be accomplished without Leo's talents: unwavering self-belief in one's personal vision and true leadership. Leo demands creativity and caring, which requires the Aquarian rejection of personal glorification in favor of global identification. When balanced, the Leo/Aquarius polarity works hand in hand to further the evolution of human civilization. Corruption, greed and suffering only exist when these energies lack equilibrium.  The Leo Full Moon assures us all that we have great personal power and we must learn to use it judiciously. This is the Full Moon to try on the role of leader. If you have wanted to come out front with your great ideas, this is the time to try. The connection with ego identity is strong on this Full Moon. Leo understands how much power it can wield, and will never shy away from using this knowledge to accomplish even the most outrageous goals. Forget the stereotypical Leo: a partygoer dancing with a lampshade on their head. Instead, think of showing up with a serious commitment to who you are and not backing down for anything. Leo is total self-belief and it uses total commitment to gain success and glory. Think of Madonna (Sun in Leo); she is a powerful presence who insists upon owning her vision and maintaining total control of the product. As we say in Silicon Valley, ""it's all about believing your own marketing."" Yes, of course there is a dark side to power and glory. We all know that an inflated ego creates the right conditions for abuses of power. But power used wisely can be of great benefit to all.   The beauty of Leo is how much it truly cares about others, and since this is a Full Moon, let's get into a celebratory space and bask in the light of Leo's positive qualities. This is the most dramatic, elegant and fun Full Moon of the year. So get out and enjoy the fireworks!    Source:   urlLink Astrowisdom

       urlLink April 2003 Outlook from Moonsurfing.com   Dear Moonsurfers,  The Moon is New in Aries on Tuesday April 1st at 11:19 AM PST. Happy Lunar New Year!   Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Mars is closer to earth than it's been in 79,000 years!  The pressure to handle this planet's energy was never stronger. The high road for this energy is that of the sacred warrior while the low road reminds us that when colored with fear, assertion can become aggression. This New Moon in Aries brings you golden opportunities to redefine and redirect the way you use this personally assertive energy. Here's the cosmic context.  The Sun, Moon, and Mercury are partying in Aries, so blunt speech, as in speaking without thinking could make you the April Fool.  Use the quick-paced mental skills of Mercury's presence in Aries to think before you speak and come up with positive loving scenarios and brilliant win-win solutions. Channel your energy into positive avenues that support your self-confidence.  Get ready for a shot of growth and optimism as Jupiter turns direct on April 3rd after a retrograde period that started on Dec. 4th.  This gave you an opportunity to look at the things in your life that you don't want expanding.  Eliminate these with the help of Spirit as Jupiter movesforward and the spark you ignite with your intentions can grow  quickly.   Mars, the ruling planet of this Aries New Moon, currently travels through Capricorn and unites exactly with Chiron while squaring the Moon, Sun, Capricorn. What this means is that action will be taken and there will be some changes made. Use your energy efficiently and, when old wounds come up, remain open to alternative ways of dealing and healing.    This New Moon is a gift of enormous personal creative energy from the universe to use as you wish, so step forward boldly and courageously hand in hand and heart to heart with Spirit. Claim the adventure that is your life and make of it what you desire. Remember that old Chinese proverb that says, ""The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.""                   Wishing you a Gloriously Creative New Moon,                                                            Claudia

Joseph Addison  The Taurus New Moon on May Day kicks off a powerful planetary boogie  that lasts all month long! This holiday celebrates Maia, the mother  goddess, and coincides with the New Moon in the first earth sign of the  zodiac, Taurus.  Deepen your connection with the material world through  your senses, your body, your possessions, and Mother Nature herself.   This is the first of two New Moons in May and the magic of new  beginnings, along with the pressure to take out the garbage, is seriously  amplified by the addition of two eclipses at the time of the Full Moon and  the 2nd New Moon. Be sure to sign up for the upcoming Telephone Seminar  during the Full Moon Phase on May 18th. You'll learn how to harness all  of these dynamic life-changing energies and have an opportunity to ask  me your questions.  As you take stock of resources and define security, and abundance for  yourself, you're building a base for your life to come. Earthly  practicalities must be tended to and here are the cosmic currents urging you  on.  A grand fixed cross squarely provides the kick-off and guarantees a  change in the physical status quo. The first leg is occupied by the Sun (Spirit shining through the  material world of resources), the Moon (emotional need for material grounding  and security), Mercury retrograde (encouraging slow, patient,  penetrating review of your consciousness regarding personal and planetary  resources), and Ceres (Goddess of the Earth encouraging you to nurture  yourself by communing and creating with nature) all in Taurus.  The next leg is occupied by Jupiter in Leo on one side  (inviting an  enlightened basis for security and wealth), Neptune in Aquarius on the  other (targeting areas of collective confusion and deception and shifting  perceptions concerning our humanitarian dreams), and the last leg held  up by Juno in Scorpio (bringing opportunities to break through to new  levels of abundance through equitable sharing of power and resources).   This cosmic standoff can be used for great creativity and progress or  to produce deception and gluttony. Chiron, retrograde at 18 degrees  Capricorn, demands we know when less can be more, for the long-term good of  our personal and planetary health.           The challenge and gift of a Taurus Moon is unconditional self-love and  acceptance. Never underestimate the value of your greatest resource,  yourself in co-creatorship with Spirit. Getting clear about what and how  much you really need to thrive can help you eliminate excess stuff.  This helps you reclaim precious energy you'll need so you're able to take  advantage of the dynamic life-changing energies in store for you this  month.              Things don't happen easily or quickly now. Plant an intention to  strengthen your patience and maintain a positive focus.                   Claudia

      CANCER LUNAR CYCLE  June 29 - July 27  from  urlLink http://www.moonsurfing.com/    The Cancer lunar cycle marks our entry into the 2nd quarter of the lunar year.   Tune into feelings and take decisive action to further your creative goals as the light and waxing energy increases.   Ideas and resources focused on in the first quarter of this lunar year will provide nourishment for the creative birthing that is to come.   This lunar energy engenders highly intuitive emotionally sensitive energy. Take advantage of opportunities to target and heal emotional stumbling blocks so you can manifest the reality you truly want.   Emotional and spiritual nourishment are emphasized. It's important that you manage this energy by taking care of your needs so they're not projected onto your relationships and the world at large.   Spend time at home to make it more comfortable and inviting for you and your family. Enjoy music, good food, relish your emotional connections, and soothe your soul with creative pursuits.   This lunar month ruled by the Moon reminds you that you can't draw from an empty well. Revisit and reclaim that which nurtures and nourishes you on the deepest levels.

       urlLink June 2003 Outlook from Moonsurfing.com    Dear Moonsurfers,  The Moon is New in Gemini on Friday May 30th at 9:20 PM PST  urlLink http://www.moonsurfing.com/nm-ovr.html  for our monthly overview go to:  urlLink http://www.moonsurfing.com/mo-ovr.html   This Gemini New Moon has many explosive aspects and could definitely be  stressful. This is the climax to a very cosmically complex month.  Remember the importance of breathing fully and deeply. May 30th, or 31st  depending n your time zone, is the 2nd brand new beginning gifted to us by  the month of May and the accompanying solar eclipse provides us with  the opportunity to move forward in new directions, provided we've allowed  ourselves to process the feelings stirred up by the Full Moon lunar  eclipse.     Imagination and magic are heightened at the time of this New Moon ( the  2nd New Moon in one month is called a Black Moon in the Wiccan  tradition and denotes a time when magic/alchemy is extremely powerful.) A  sextile to this New Moon from Jupiter in Leo (expansion and broader  horizons) and Neptune in Aquarius (our field of dreams) sends a message telling  us that we can create what we can imagine.  Don't put too much on your  plate or you'll lose your focus and sacrifice much-needed clarity.  This eclipse may well pop information concerning the shady dealings of  Congress and the FCC concerning private and corporate media interests  in radio and television broadcasting. Freedom of speech and  communication is a basic tenet upon which this country was built, so stay aware of  what's happening and make those calls and write those letters. The  shift from Taurus (ruler of the throat) to Gemini within the month of May  reminds you to let your voice be heard.   On June 3rd, Saturn vacates Gemini after a 3-year stay and begins a  journey through Cancer that will last until July 16, 2005. Woman's issues  will be more prominent and the political, economic, and personal  lessons of the last 30 years come up for a reality check. (The first woman's  bank, the first woman to climb Mt. Everest, the first woman priests  ordained in the Anglican and Episcopalian churches, as well as Watergate,  worldwide inflation and the oil embargo/energy crisis marked the last  transit of Saturn through Cancer.)   Venus (ruler of Taurus, love, beauty and the way we attract what we  need on the material plane) and Mercury (the way we think and assimilate  information) are united in Taurus reminding us to connect heart and mind  to find win-win solutions. Stay positive, keep an open mind, cultivate  a willingness to listen, and tune into the adventurous excitement of  the new world that's opening up.     Remember that your consciousness creates, so reflect and  get ready to  co-create a new direction by committing your thoughts, feelings, words,  and actions to the universal mind of which we're all a part.

       VIRGO LUNAR CYCLE  Aug 27 - Sep 24, 2003  The New Moon in Virgo on August 27 begins a 29.6-day cycle about developing  analytical skills , a  sense of discrimination  and the  ability to recognize patterns . This preparatory stage in the process of our development gives us time to improve our situation by attending to details. The simple rituals of daily life will provide the grounding necessary for balance. This is an especially good period to work on the mind-body connection.   Analyze and adjust daily routines to support physical and mental well being. Good health, altruistic service and productive employment support success; practicality and prudence guarantee it. Use this cycle to  refine  and  revise  the spark of intention you ignited last spring. It's time to redesign the form the future will take.   Mercury is Retrograde  from (Aug 28-Sept 20). Retrograde means redo, rethink, rewrite, revaluate, revisit, and reanalyze. Over the next three weeks we will have the opportunity to see what needs changing in work, health, finances, and life. Mercury loves to play hide-and-go-seek with every area of communication including, travel, cars, (traffic jams), computers, break downs, and lost items.  This creates an environment of whacky, crazy-making events and mishaps. Timing is everything! If you can wait, do not sign anything until after September 20th, your patience will pay off.   Mercury is the Messenger to the gods (archetypes).  He travels freely between worlds your conscious mind (the part of you reading this right now), and the subconscious (that which is just below the threshold of your awareness) i.e., dreams, true desires, wishes. And, the unconscious mind, the unknown part of Self made conscious through others, by mirroring back to us what is deeply hidden both light, and dark.    All of life is energy.  I am energy. You are energy. The personal and planetary astrology represents the energy patterns in motion we are currently utilizing (working with) consciously or unconsciously.  We live cycles within cycles.  With the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter the planet of wealth, blessings, gifts from the gods, and expansion, moving into Virgo also, where Jupiter will stay for the next year, we are invited to heal our health and advance our careers. Watch for making mountains(Jupiter) out of molehills (Virgo). We are building towards the fullmoon.  Plant your seeds (New Moon) and prepare for the harvest (Full Moon).         In this cycle of Virgo perfection, why not practice being  ""unconditionally constructive""  that is no self-criticism or criticism of others, continuously focus on the positive, if we send out positive energy we will get back positive results, this is the Law of Attraction.  What is working in your life?  Instead of getting caught up in the negatives and fueling frustration, why not  express gratitude  for your blessings and practice the Law of Allowing.   Explore this Virgo cycle deeply and the secrets of financial/personal success.  Money is not the root of all-evil.  It is what we do with it!  We must evolve beyond the fear of money, sense of limitation, and struggle.  The power (global) elite are crumbling!  We the people are winning. As bad as things may seem, events are minuscule compared to what was seen (prophesized). We are moving into the light (energy) of the fifth dimension, a vibration of love, compassion and abundance.   Monthly Affirmation:  I serve the highest good through Love. I filter information without judgment. I find perfection in the moment.

       LEO LUNAR CYCLE  July 28 - August 26 Interpretation by Maya del Mar from  urlLink http://www.daykeeperjournal.com   Leo is about expressing our selfhood, our personal centers, the heart of ourselves, that natural order within us which comes from spirit, and the expression of which gives our lives joy and drama and meaning. Leo is about integrity, nobility, honor, generosity, being true to the unfolding of ourselves and sharing that unfolding freely. In Cancer we created our personal, safe spot, our home port, our power place. Now in Leo we can grow in the garden which weve created, and blossom there for all the world to see. Leo is associated with flower gardens, which capture the sun not for utility but for beautys sake, simply to show off the splendors of life. On joyous and ceremonial occasions we give flowers, a symbol of sharing the divine love which we feel in our hearts.   Leo is a time when we have the power to bring new life energy from our deepest humanitarian resources into expression in our character and daily activities. Think of the Sun, endlessly radiating heat and light to the solar system. Now we can incorporate that great energy into our own centers. Leo leads to growth in our creative talents by strengthening both mind and will. Abstract thought is stimulated, as is power, confidence, and enthusiasm. Our receptivity to subtle forces and the powers of the imagination are also increased.   Self-mastery can take a giant leap during Leo time, leading to a new appreciation of our capabilities and an enhanced feeling of identity. Leo is also inspirational. Vacationing, traveling, enjoying and celebrating the beauties of creation are Leonian. The greatest expression of Leo is lovethe divine force which nurtures that which it has created. So now, during Leo time, let the love flowlove of nature, love of ourselves, love of our fellow humans, and love of the omnipresent divine spark.  Bill Clinton is a very Leo type. Notice his lions mane, his commanding presence, and the magnetic radiance which beams from him. He has created his own life and forged his own destiny with a strong sense of purpose, and in the process has inspired people around him, all Leo qualities. Carl Jung, with sun in Leo, broke from Freud and viewed the psyche as an evolving, growing center from which, like a mandala, life patterns radiatean expression of the sun within ourselves. Rosalynn Carter and Jacqueline Onassis are examples of Leo First Ladies. They both illustrate the natural dignity of Leo. Pride and arrogance can be Leo pitfalls.""

       urlLink SCORPIO LUNAR CYCLE  by Crystal Pomeroy Oct. 25 - Nov. 22 This Scorpio New Moon begins the lunar cycle marked by Samhain, Halloween (originally, Hallows Mass), El Día de los Muertos, and All Souls' Daythe classic Scorpio festivities around the world. Prayerful reflection sets this lunation and the intense energies it entails off to a high-vibration start. It also gives us a chance to move into the years end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong Saturn influences.  According to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of lifes most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated. The current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, Earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to  tap into transpersonal forces .  According to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank Spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit.  From these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest. On special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by Wikkans and Central Americans of native descent). At its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (Mother Earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear.  The race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the Samhain New Moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to  multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a Samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding:  strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing years goals . Stay tuned to our meditation for the Full Moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our years work, as we will also share a magical Full Moon offering to heal Mother Earth.  Before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, lets reflect on what this particular Samhain New Moon has to do with tolerance. In the first place, Wikkans especially focus on that virtue at this time, as they pay homage their predecessors who were burned at the stake by European churches. Furthermore, the intense Saturn stationary-retrograde which takes place right with this New Moon gives us a chance to effectively remake how we exercise our moral, and, as it is in Cancer, emotional, judgment nature. Metaphysically speaking, we have a chance to soften the punishing patriarch within,  informing our judgment nature with love , staying the mental hand that would condemn without previous, compassionate reflection.  Tolerance is a personal and global necessity. As remotely savage as the witch-burnings may seem, the danger of such extreme, thoughtless outbursts will lurk ever beneath the surface of our daily normalcy until we include careful, open-minded consideration, both compassionate and rational, in our a way of thought and life. Politically, such an approach can protect us from mass manipulation into rash, fundamentalist support of scapegoating, such as evidenced in Nazi Germany, the McCarthy witch-hunts, modern day treatment of Muslims, and the recent special elections in California.  The following principle is inscribed on the emerald tablet, ""As above, so below."" If you are still reading this by now, chances are youre among those who consider ourselves relatively tolerant. In such cases, prayer is a strong ally to pass from philosophic lenience to the ability to release emotional condemnation of those whose value systems diverge, even widely, from our own. Moral tolerance does not necessarily imply putting up with unacceptable conditions, but rather  staying free from the judgment trap , of sentencing those that differ from our most cherished tenets. Prayer for this intent can release us to the Power of Higher Love, which in turn will touch our personal realms, eventually influencing the larger communities of city, state, country and globe, lifting all levels up into a magical sphere of protection for the planet, for Spirit, for ourselves and for every visible and invisible being. This dimension of inner abundance will survive even when our outer forms, like the harvests last fruits, are released unto Mother Earth.  Call on the Power of Endings to usher in a happy close to your passing year!  1) Make a list of those goals for work and other applied efforts you can remember having at the beginning of 2003.  2) On another page, briefly describe those activities, situations, behaviors, beliefs or attachments which you feel have kept you from consolidating those goals.  3) Call on the Angel of Endings, and ask her to assist you in accepting the demise of whatever situations would delay the consolidation of your divine plan for 2003. Then declare aloud, 13 times, as you visualize their meaning:  I CALL ON THE POWER OF ENDINGS WHICH IS NOW RENEWING THE EARTH, TO ELIMINATE ALL THAT WOULD DELAY THE CONSOLIDATION OF MY HIGHEST WORK. JUST AS LEAVES NOW FALL AWAY AND ARE DISSOLVED INTO THE EARTH, THOSE SITUATONS, ACTIVITIES, BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS THAT NEED TO, NOW DROP FROM THE PANORAMA OF MY LIFE SO THAT MY HIGHEST ENDEAVORS MAY CONSOLIDATE AND PROSPER, QUICKLY AND IN PEACE.

After perfecting and organizing the resources you developed over the last six months, you're ready to  share your creative and emotional harvest  with others.   This cycle emphasizes  balance  in all areas of your life. Adapt your health regimen to the seasonal change and be sure to include relaxation and meditation while allocating time for inward and outward activities.   Existing relationships, social interactions and new partnerships come to center stage. First strengthen your relationship with yourself by asking Spirit to help you in releasing old hurts and resentments so your personal wholeness is supported.   Collaboration and compromise provide win-win solutions to challenges confronting you, as long as you maintain your individual sense of balance. View yourself and the world with a loving heart, an open mind, and remember the underlying divine spark in others. Libra's ruler, Venus, emphasizes balance, beauty, grace, harmony, peace and love.

       urlLink SAGITTARIUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com Nov. 23 - Dec. 22  It's time to lighten up, laugh and celebrate life.   Emotional stumbling blocks, outworn beliefs and areas calling for forgiveness are touched by powers of transformation as a total solar eclipse kicks off this lunar cycle.   Winter officially begins as the solstice occurs on Dec. 21st underscoring the shift towards the light. Following the deep emotional elimination process kicked off by the Harmonic Concordance eclipse set-up, ask yourself  what's true for you . Expand your viewpoint, cultivate a generous spirit and remember that your truth may not be everyone's truth. This cycle brings new opportunities and you're more aware of your place in the wider world now. Allow your life to tell a new story of possibilities, growth and fulfillment.   Sagittarius is the sign of risk-taking and expanding horizons. Perhaps the relinquishment of the outworn yet dearly held beliefs that form the very foundations of our lives is the biggest risk of all. Whatever you experienced on or around November 22, 1984 as well as May 21,1993 and May 25, 1994 provide clues as to what's being re-energized by this eclipse. Along with the broader awareness being popped by this eclipse, you can come into a greater love of self by  letting go of intolerance with yourself and your process.   We're flexing brand new muscles of perception. There's much wisdom to be gained as we open to new ideas and possibilities that are shifting and connecting us at the deepest levels of our souls.   Remember that old old phrase. ""As you believe, so it is done unto you."" It's time to reclaim your true power by reaffirming  the truth of who you really are.  Utilize the powerfully expansive energies of this Jupiter-ruled cycle and the ignition sparks provided by the New Moon Solar Eclipse set up to complete the surrender into your true identity as higher greater Self. Then walk that truth as you move toward your highest goals. All things are possible, if you believe.

As the light returns, prepare to enter a year of love, relationship, responsibility, and healing under the vibration of the number ""6"". Heed the call to consolidate your resources, set new limits and goals, and be more self-reliant.   Mercury continues to move in retrograde motion till January 6th.  Reflect on the lessons you've learned and get clear about where you need to set new limits and boundaries so you can accomplish your goals.  Think out of the box for alternative solutions to areas calling for healing.   As the month progresses, strike a balance between your desires for status and achievement in the outer world with time spent attending to family, feelings, and rest and renewal of body and soul. Utilize challenging situations to decide what needs to change. Then make a comprehensive plan and remember that patience, persistence and preparation are valuable resources.   Last month's lunar energy encouraged you to set off with providential trust, hope, and a belief in good fortune. This month's energy requires that you  align with your highest intentions and diligently prepare for your journey leaving nothing to chance .

Now is the time to plant the seeds of what you desire to harvest in your life, work, and relationships.  If we have been too serious and focused on work, perhaps we need to invite play back into our lives.  Aquarian energy fires lightning truth, unexpected events, and upsets into the status quo to keep life from getting too rigid, constricting, or comfortable.   Shaking and waking us up to experience new ways of living, being and loving.      Aquarius invites us into fresh starts, new roads, boldness, genius, and group membership.  Wild man Uranus is the ruling planet of Aquarius, he is outrageous, shocking, and erratic.  Uranus loves to create chaos, and upset for that which is out dated, out grown or boorishly stuck.  We will continue to experience a breakdown in paradigms, institutions, and organizations that are in truth obsolete.  The light is oncoming and the Age of Aquarius is dawning.  Uranus is in the spiritual sign Pisces for the next eight years, erasing boundaries between the spiritual and physical worlds, technology will boom with space age inventions.  Your intuitve and psychic abilities will continue to grow.  Pay attention to your dreams they are filled with life directing knowledge. Where do you need more freedom?     On a planetary level, we are closing out the Piscean Age, and ending a 26,000-year cycle.  We are now entering the Age of Aquarius and starting a new 26,000 year cycle.    In truth, we live cycles within cycles, Pisces (last two thousand years) into Aquarius (next two thousand years.) The Age of Aquarius is the promised coming revolution in higher consciousness, an age of peace, truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Where competition is replaced with cooperation.   Today is the time to prepare for higher consciousness by practicing Self-love and acceptance.  The paramount mission, individually, may be for the development of a healthy foundation with Self and Spirit. 'Self' is the inner essence, soul identity and authenticity of each individual.  When we are in alignment with Self, we base our choices upon one's true values and personal integrity, and enjoy a certain level of completion, joy, flow, and wholeness.    As individuals come into a greater sense of Self and Spirit, they assist in raising the consciousness of the planet, as  well as themselves.   When our cup is full, we are available to assist others.  This lifetime offers a grand opportunity to live in a new level of awareness, authenticity and happiness.  We are the seedlings of the Aquarian Age, the forerunners plowing the way for greater souls of light to embody with us and take us to Greatest Party we have experienced in thousands of years, the Golden Age of Aquarius.

       urlLink Pisces Lunar Cycle  by Ronni Lynn Feb 20 - March 20  This month the New Moon will be in the sign of Pisces. Pisces is a most mystical sign because it deals with the unconscious side of life and ourselves.  Pisces' influence dissolves boundaries- those barriers that separate people and even nations from understanding each other.  When boundaries are lifted we experience compassion, true understanding and a gentleness toward ourselves and each other. In order to accomplish this we must first deal with dissolving those boundaries within ourselves. By this I mean the differences between our external selves (how we act, dress, what we say we believe, etc) with our internal selves- who we truly are. When we are free to reflect to the outside who we really are then we will experience increased authenticity. With this authenticity we will begin to experience true connections with others. After all, if we are being a true reflection of ourselves, it will be our truth that others will be responding to. What a wonderful foundation for any relationship! When people who are being true to themselves interact, when their internal, and/or subconscious self is reflected outwardly, barriers between them will melt because they will have an understanding of each other. We all have much more in common than we realise or would like to admit. With this in mind, this is a good time to forgive others who have wronged us, ask forgiveness, or to forgive ourselves for past failures.   A good way to find your inner truth is to quiet your mind, to meditate and just observe what comes up. Sometimes defense mechanisms that may have served us at the time of a traumatic experience persist and only serve to block our true energies from arising. You can sometimes tell that this is happening when you no longer allow yourself to feel vulnerable emotionally with others. This is a time when as we relax our minds and bodies we learn to release those tensions that block our emotional response with others. Pisces rules higher ideals, dreams and inspirations.  Let your imagination and creativity expand during this time.  We can wish to increase our spiritual awareness, our surrender to and faith in a higher power, or to find the correct spiritual path or teacher. At this time perhaps we can come to a realization that everything has a purpose, we are all connected, and that there is a perfect order to the universe. We are all part of the unfolding of that universe. This is a good month to wish for a decrease in feeling like a victim, or in feeling helpless or out of control. These are Pisces qualities that can go overboard. We need to  curb a tendency for complete escapism , such as overuse of alcohal or drug abuse. While fantasy and inspiration can work to help us develop into more evolved beings, to expand our possibilities, we can also  learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, truth from fiction . We must avoid the tendency to deceive ourselves and others with escapism. Pisces energy helps us dream, and offers us the opportunity to use that dream to make the world a better place for everyone. Neptune's energy can be harnessed to increase our creativity and creative expression in art, writing, dance, drama, or music.  Dreams and inspiration are the first steps before action.    The next sign, Aries will take the actions that follow the dreams that Pisces created. Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and with the dreams of Pisces feeding unconsciously into the energies of the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries, the cycle is again complete. The next new moon will be in Aries on March 20, 2004 at 5:42 PM. E.S.T. Come visit me then or a few days before for more New Moon reflections.   With Blessings- Ronni

Daylight savings time occurs on April 4th further underscoring the shift towards  more and more light .   Last month you grounded yourself by strengthening your spiritual connection, getting in touch with your dreams and reaching for a higher love. Remember to utilize the warrior energy of Aries in a most sacred way as you  take action to manifest those qualities and dreams .   A 3-week Mercury Retrograde period begins on April 6th bringing you an opportunity to take care of unfinished business as you prepare to move full tilt boogie in new directions. The combination of planetary energies reminds you to  temper your ideas with patience, persistence and prudence  as you pursue lasting goals and values. Don't energize negativity, but  hone your intent and harness your will  in the most positive ways as you blast off into the fresh start of a most promising spring.

       urlLink TAURUS LUNAR CYCLE  by Dana Gerhardt @  urlLink http://www.mooncircles.com   April 19 - May 20  This New Moon brings a partial Solar Eclipse. Eclipses bring a dramatic acceleration or sudden turn of events. What has recently changed for you? Eclipses force much needed changes to the surface. Their shakedown makes it easier to release worn-out behaviors, attitudes and relationships. Their  turbulence impels us to grow .    This New Moon is particularly potent. It is the second New Moon in Aries this year. Wasat the Aries New Moon last monthyour inner heroic nature roused to action? You may have found that what was stagnant in your life was becoming unbearable. Spring is about initiating action. Leaves suddenly fill out bare branches. Hyacinth and tulip bulbs shoot up from the ground.  Where have you been springing forth?  This is the second cycle of Artemisgoddess of the Moon and goddess of the hunt. She is summoned in each of us this season, expressed in our joyous independence, in our nurturing and courageous action.   Perhaps the most important resolve you might make this New Moon is to shift your focus from what you dont wanton to what you do.  Your future will be created by what you place your mind on now.  If youre focused on irritations or lack, you will get more of the same. If you fill your heart with winning feelings, if you  fill your mind with images of success , the momentum towards a brighter future will build. Negative energy only brings more negativity. The tulip bulb shooting up from the earth doesnt think ""I dont want more winter."" It is thinking ""I want to be a luscious bloom."" When you do likewise this cycle, a resplendent future will be speeding your way.

        urlLink GEMINI LUNAR CYCLE : By Rev. Pauline Southard  This month's lunar cycle has an overall scattered feeling especially after May 21, 2004 when the Sun leaves Taurus for light and mutable Gemini. We feel we are jumping from one thing to another. Taking even just a few minutes to regroup will truly help this month. The New Moon of May 19, 2004 arrives at 12:51 AM EDT. This is the last gasp of the very fixed Taurus energy we experienced during the last lunar cycle. This New Moon lies at the very bottom of the chart, beckoning us to plant our spring gardens and attend to matters around the house. We could really use a little time out from work. A household crisis requires that we scramble to manipulate our schedules.  Our committed love relationships are smooth sailing now. Sexual intimacy provides us with a wonderful nurturing connection that lasts long after the physical act is completed. Truly a meeting of souls.   This part of the lunar cycle provides us with great potential to plan our summer vacations and those of the children we are responsible for. A sibling conveys some good advice concerning matters of the heart and/or financial affairs.   The First Quarter Moon of May 27, 2004 at 3:56 AM EDT starts its work while we are still dreaming. The Sun has now entered Gemini. Gemini energy in its pure form is all about communication, inquisitiveness and love of socializing. At its best, its clever wit can cause us to look at matters from a different perspective while laughing. When this energy is used negatively, it can denote lack of focus, the facile & easy answer over the deeper and more thoughtful approach and a disregard for others feelings.   Expect some unexpected expenses that may impede our goals in the short term. However, towards the end of the First Quarter Moon, we find that our partners are particularly helpful in very practical and substantial ways.  The Full Moon of June 3, 2004 at 12:19 AM EDT makes everything appear larger than life as the Sun and Moon depart from a square to Jupiter. Relax! Although we feel that we must do it all perfectly, perhaps an adequate job will suffice without totally stressing us out. Any recent tensions in our relationships ease now. It could be fun to see a play or an unusual foreign movie now.  The Third Quarter Moon of June 9, 2004 at 4:02 PM EDT heightens our emotional sensitivity. We are particularly adept at tuning into our lovers and childrens feelings. A great time to go to the beach and paint! Or we could single mindedly pursue projects that have seemed to have had a missing element until now and complete them. It is a great week for a trip with a lover- either an inner or literal journey would be wonderful now.

        Lunar Energy: Full Moon Rituals   The moon has always played an important part in ancient spiritual practices. Since the beginning of time, people have recognized lunar power, which is where the term, ""lunacy"" comes from. Even today there is much speculation as to the affects of the moon's phases, particularly the full moon, on our moods and behavior. The belief behind full moon rituals is to harness lunar power to the benefit of oneself and others. Ceremonies performed at this phase of the moon are meant for empowerment, as well to manifest positive changes.   The full moon appears once every 29.53 days, therefore rituals can be performed almost every month, sometimes even twice a month. And, you need not be outside or even see the full moon to reap its powerful benefits. There are many full moon rituals, some more complex than others, involving magical tools and enhancements. Yet, many are quite simple, including a moon bask which is just that, basking in the full moonlight and meditating. You can do the ritual standing, sitting, or laying on the ground, or even indoors if it's more practical. Just stand by a large window, open if possible, and meditate on that which would enhance your life.   One well-known ceremony is ""Drawing Down the Moon,"" to connect with the power and wisdom of the full moon. In Wicca traditions, a priestess performs the ceremony in order for her to become the living embodiment of the mood goddess. There are also rituals where all participants ""draw down the moon"" to evoke the deity of the moon within themselves. For a healing ritual, Selena Fox, of the Circle Craft tradition, offers this Moon Mirror Healing. Place a silvered mirror face up on an altar or sacred place so that the light of the full moon shines upon it. Place a symbol to represent the one seeking healing in the center of the mirror. The symbol may be a photo, piece of jewelry, lock of hair, or simply a name on a card. Use the symbol on the mirror in the moonlight as a focal point as you imagine that the one needing healing is becoming well and then healthy. After the ritual, deliver the symbol to the subject of the healing rite as an additional way of transmitting healing. Cleanse the mirror you used by washing it with a mugwort solution or passing it through the smoke from mugwort or another incense. In this way, the mirror will be ready for use for another healing.   Whether you perform simple or elaborate full moon rituals, or just enjoy the beauty of the full moon, you're participating in a long tradition of showing appreciation for a powerful source of illumination.

      From: KnowledgeNews  info@knowledgenews.net >  Prepare to be mooned--blue mooned.  This Saturday, July 31, a ""blue moon"" rises.  Of course, you probably won't see even a hint of blue color, just your average full moon. So what gives? What's so blue about a moon that isn't? Heck, astronomers even say that blue moons aren't rare. And folklorists say they're not what everyone thinks they are.  As any budding astronomer can tell you, a ""blue moon"" is the second full moon in a calendar month. It isn't really blue. It's just a name. But why, of all things, do we call a white moon ""blue"" Actually, there are truly blue moons.   In 1883, an Indonesian volcano erupted with the force of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb. With a roar heard nearly 400 miles (over 600 kilometers) away, Mount Krakatoa belched a column of volcanic gas and ash into the atmosphere. That night, the moon rose blue over Indonesia. Particles from Krakatoa's ash, not more than a micron wide, made it happen. These micron-wide particles were exactly the right size to scatter red light, while allowing other colors, such as blue, to pass. The result: a blue sphere hanging in the sky. Different sized particles filtered other colors and caused different effects. In fact, for several years after the eruption, there were reports fro mall over the globe of red moons, green moons, and, yes, even more blue moons..   What's more, some of the sunsets following the eruption were such a blazing red that people actually called on firemen to drown the optical illusion.. The eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo produced the same anomaly.  So have forest fires. Still, none of this explains why we call the second full moon in a month a blue moon. The phrase is old, even if the modern meaning is not. Before Shakespeare penned a word of Hamlet, the English knew little couplets like: If they say the moon is blewe, we must believe that it is true.

       urlLink CANCER LUNAR CYCLE  by Maya del Mar  July 17 - August 16   During the passage of the sun through Cancer we are  extraordinarily open to our inner selves , to our own depths, to our own connections with the universe. The vulnerability of this state increases our need for security, and we find ourselves attending to those aspects of our lives which center in our own hearthour inner child, our family, our domestic lives, our homes, our businessesthose things which relate to creating a stable base, those situations in which we find  safety and comfort .   The Sun enters the sign of Cancer at Summer Solstice. This is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. At that moment the days begin to shorten, the night force takes over, and we begin our six-month journey of gradually embracing the darkness, which climaxes at winter solstice on December 21.   Like the night to which she introduces us,  the forces of Cancer are mysterious . They are ruled by the Moon, the Goddess of the Night, who brings her waxing and waning lanterns to guide us through the dark, through the murky unconscious, through the watery depths of feeling.   In Gemini we made connections with every passing event, as we restlessly kept ourselves in motion, learning about the world, exploring. Now in Cancer it is time to center ourselves, to  turn within  and learn who we are and what we need, to nurture our inner child and create a safe home for it. The darkness of the subconscious is our real staging ground for life, and we must develop lines of support to anchor ourselves to its vastness, while at the same time maintaining fluid passageways for growth, for change, and for movement to new levels.   In Aries, we brought the seed of spirit to earth, in Taurus we multiplied the seeds, in Gemini the air swept them up to disperse them, and now in Cancer each seed will  find its proper spot in which to put down strong roots .   It is most appropriate that we plant our gardens by the moon, which rules Cancer. The moon fluctuates within its monthly cycle, and also is connected with the daily fluctuations of tidal waters throughout the world. Underlying this fluctuation, which may seem capricious if we dont pay attention to lifes rhythms, there are regular cycles and predictability. The energy of Cancer, similarly, is a fluctuating movementgoing within to deep sources and then moving out to express those depths in the world, ever shifting as do the ocean currents. But like the moon Cancer has its inner predictability, and is accountable to its own rhythms.   Cancer rules containers of all kinds, including the womb, where young life is nourished, and the home, where families are nourished. It rules gestation, that vulnerable time when an embryo is being formed deep within layers of protection.   Cancer is associated with bodies of fluid, such as lakes and amniotic sacs. It knows. It knows that water, which symbolizes emotions in astrology, is the essential matrix of life, and that feelings are tender and vulnerable and must be protected, just as the growing fetus must be protected. It knows intimately about growth, because it carries the growth process within itself. And growth, too, must be protected and attended to so that the fledgling is strong and healthy.   The Sabian Symbol for 26 Cancer is:   ""GUESTS ARE READING IN THE LIBRARY OF A LUXURIOUS HOME. The transference of social privilege to the level of intellectual enjoyment. We see the concretization of cultural excellence and wealth at the level at which individuals can exercise their developmental capacities in comfort. The process is individualized because the library belongs to a private residence, the luxury of which implies an individuals concentration upon the acquisition of wealth. Maintaining CLASS STANDARDS OF INFORMATION. What is at stake here is the need to conform to the requirements of ones social status.""

       The Dining Room  Dining tables should not be placed in front of the main door.  A dining table that faces the toilet receives too much Yin and can negatively affect health.  A dining table should not be used as partition between two rooms.  If a dining table faces the kitchen or is in the kitchen area, it receives too much Yang and the diners might develop a bad temperament.  Air conditioning, central heating and fans are best kept on the left side of the dining room.

      Do not use a beater bar vac by all means. Even if the bristles are soft, it only takes one paperclip to get caught up in it to really mess up your floors. As far as wheels go, best not to do that either. No, I don't expect the appliance to float above the floor mysteriously, but a damaged plastic or a metal wheel can cause considerable damage in a short amount of time.   Expect higher maintainence on wood floors than carpet and expect to clean it more often. Carpet acts as a filter and absorbs dust and dirt. Wood can't. I have dark stained red oak (finish is tung oil) wood flooring thru out my home and have always used my dust mop (sometimes lightly mist dust mop with water) with my dustpan, then mop with warm water which mop is wrung out till almost dry/damp and then mop my floor. My mother lives in her old family home which was built in the 1870s and she always used a dust mop and never used a vacuum and her floors are beautiful!   Another good workable and cheap solution.... a small shop vac. I bought the 2Gal/2.0 HP sized one at Lowes for $29 and it sucks up everything (including the drapes). Also, for quick cleanups of pet hair balls and the like, I use the dry swifter mop.

When clothes reach ""damp dry"", the dryer already ""knows"" how long it will take them to be completely dry because it knows the types of clothes being dried (whether they're heavy or light) and how long it took them to reach the damp dry point. This accuracy helps prevent overdrying and shortens cycle times by up to 20 minutes.

       urlLink By Brian Ogan, Designer : Accentuate tall, open spaces. Don't clutter walls with small pieces of art. A favorite tactic is to fill a large pot with river rocks and arrange tall bamboo stems that fan out and reach to the ceiling. An interesting sculpture also works well.   Warm up a wall. Paint a single wall in a soft sage or a warm wine. This adds a welcome touch of color and warmth.   Get smart about storage. Carefully plan every piece of furniture to control clutter. Open shelving is also a good option, because it keeps the wall exposed and maintains the open feeling of the room.    Use lighting as art.  Simple, modern wall sconces are attractive and provide soft illumination without using up valuable surface space.    Use area rugs as anchors. Area rugs help break down a loft space into separate living areas, without sacrificing overall openness. They also warm up bare floors and help reduce echoes.   Maintain open space. Arrange furniture so it does not block views to windows and doors. Modern benches, stools, and ottomans are great because their simple, clean lines don't obstruct views and minimize the feel of a small room. Coffee tables and lamp tables with clear glass will give you extra surface space but won't make a room look cluttered. Avoid overstuffed sofas and chairs.

       urlLink Storage Ideas :  A large garbage can may be covered with a round plywood top, draped with a round skirt and pronto -- storage for a variety of household items.  Ladders or step stools topped with shelves or a flush door table top provide storage space, display area, desk or work surface.  Adding legs and cushions to a door or other flat board makes a bench, bed or sofa. Casters may also be used in place of legs. Without the cushions, you have a movable plant stand to display collections, books or records.  Bricks (stone, concrete or glass) and boards can be used for bookshelves, shoe shelves, end tables, coffee tables and plant stands.  Use five-sided cubes for a number of things. A basic 15-inch cube made of plywood can be a coffee table, an end table, a storage unit, a cushioned seat or almost anything you like, and in any color because it is easy to paint or enamel. Brightly painted cubes lined up along the floor of a child's room will hold books and toys. Stack them up in your family room to hold books, small TV, stereo equipment, and decorative objects. Stacked units can be used for a two-faced room divider with open sides facing either way.  Storage containers can be made from boxes, tin cans, baskets or other recycled containers. These can be painted, covered with self-adhesive paper, wallpaper, fabric. Sturdy old tables, chests or storage units can look attractive through refinishing, painting, application of self-adhesive paper or upholstering with easily-cared-for fabric.   New or used filing cabinets may be used in a variety of ways to provide an abundance of storage. Cover them with fabric, wallpaper or a coat of paint to make them more attractive.

As Barney Capehart says; 'If everyone went to the store today and bought high efficiency products or devices for their homes, offices, and factories, Florida could cut its energy use in half.'  Daylighting through skylights and windows can be economical. Only indirect light generates less heat than electric lamps. Skylights can be modified with white paint, lenses, or reflective film to reduce solar heat gain.  Incandescent lamps are the most widely used, and the least efficient. Low pressure sodium vapor lamps, one of the most efficient light sources, uses 9 times less electricity for the same brightness, produce less heat, and lasts 18 times as long as incandescent lamps. Sodium lamp light, however, does not render color naturally.

Natural gas normally provides: a wider variety of temperature settings, instantaneous on/off heat, is more environmentally benign, and is more economical - the energy cost is usually half the cost of electricity.

In general, washing in warm water is the most energy efficient method; cold water washing usually requires a longer cycle or more detergent to wash the clothes to the same degree of cleanliness. Using the proper water level to fit the load is probably the most important energy saving consideration when operating a washing machine.""

       urlLink EU, NATO Throw New Lifeline to Macedonia Talks  Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski said talks between leaders of mainstream Macedonian and ethnic Albanian political parties, mediated by special EU and U.S. peace envoys, would resume in Tetovo. But he gave no exact timeframe for resuming dialogue in the city, where fierce three-day battles this week between the NLA and government troops ruined a 15-day truce. One civilian was shot dead there on Thursday, local police said, but no details were immediately available. ``Tetovo is a kind of melting pot for Macedonia. We are going to Tetovo to defend all those achievements,'' Trajkovski said in a reference to the previous round of talks, which had made some progress but stalled over whether Albanian should become an official language in some parts of Macedonia. The West has taken a lead role in trying to prevent a five-month-old ethnic Albanian rebellion in Macedonia from becoming another Balkan war.

The advance is an important step toward a goal that is still more science fiction than science: to develop artificial retinas or prosthetic limbs that are extensions of the human nervous system.

Eugene Polzik and his colleagues at the University of Aarhus are not about to beam anyone up to the Starship Enterprise, but their research reported in the science journal Nature on Wednesday makes the idea of instantly transporting an object from one place to another less far fetched.  It involves quantum entanglement -- a mysterious concept of entwining two or more particles without physical contact. Albert Einstein once described it as ``spooky action at a distance.''

       urlLink September 11, 2001   September 11 2001, the tone of America changed.  The news was relentless and none of it was good. Words conveyed the events but words failed to tell the emotional tale. As NPR covered the events, it was music that gave listeners time to reflect, to digest the images and the impact. So many letters came to NPR telling us how comforted they were by the music. In the wake of all that happened I was surprised anyone would take the time to mention the music; it seemed so trivial compared to the weeks' events. I was reminded again why composers score and why players perform. Together they create a magnificence that goes beyond the spoken word, both touching the ear and reaching the soul.   I've put together some of that music here, in part to answer some of those letters wondering what we played (precise record keeping was impossible), and also to create an aural snapshot that in some small way tries to capture the tone of a nation shaken and changed.  I hope you find comfort in this edition of All Songs Considered.  Bob Boilen Director All Things Considered

The results suggest that, while people regularly reach the same conclusions when faced with uncomfortable moral choices, their answers often do not grow out of the reasoned application of general moral principles. Instead, they draw on emotional reactions, particularly for certain kinds of moral dilemmas.  The results also show how tools of neuroscience are beginning to reveal the biological underpinnings of the subtlest elements of human behavior, said Joshua Greene, a graduate student in philosophy who conducted the study in collaboration with scientists in the psychology department and the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior.  ""We think of moral judgments as so ethereal,"" said Greene. ""Now we're in a position to start looking at brain anatomy and understanding how neural mechanisms produce patterns in our behavior.""  The study focused on a classic set of problems that have fascinated moral philosophers for years because of the difficulty in identifying moral principles that agree with the way people react.  One dilemma, known as the trolley problem, involves a runaway train t

But amid the global horror, Palestinian gunmen at refugee camps in Lebanon fired into the air on Tuesday to celebrate the news of the attacks. ``America and Israel are one. This is the result of American policy,'' one Palestinian gunman said. No one had yet claimed responsibility. Lebanese, Palestinian and Israeli leaders joined Europe, Mexico and other countries in condemning the devastating attacks that caused as yet unknown casualties. Western European leaders broke off their normal business to return to their capitals for crisis meetings and expressed solidarity with the United States. From every corner of Europe, leaders condemned attacks they branded horrendous, abominable, disgusting, monstrous and abhorrent. The European Union (news - web sites) said it was the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor 60 years ago and was ``one of those few days in life that one can actually say will change everything.'' ``This is an act of war by madmen,'' EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten told Reuters. Norway called it the worst terrorist attack in history.

The mission of the newly minted joint-venture company Linecom Inc. will be to develop and deploy ""power line communication"" systems in Japan, which would push Internet access onto existing power lines.  Formed among Kansai Electric Power Co. and Matsushita Electric Works Ltd. in Japan and Israel's Itran Communications, the new company will capitalize on Kansai Electric's knowledge of power-distribution systems, Itran's power line communication (PLC) technology and Matsushita's expertise in system integration and product design to develop a complete, start-to-finish solution, from modems to power-line networking equipment. Itran has developed a special modem that links to the Internet via household electrical outlets. Power company Kansai Electric intends to launch the service once the the Japanese government deregulates the use of high-frequency bands for PLC, which is expected to happen early next year.

       urlLink Coincidences: Remarkable or Random? (Skeptical Inquirer)   ""You don't believe in telepathy?"" My friend, a sober professional, looked askance. ""Do you?"" I replied. ""Of course. So many times I've been out for the evening and suddenly became worried about the kids. Upon calling home, I've learned one is sick, hurt himself, or having nightmares. How else can you explain it?""  Such episodes have happened to us all and it's common to hear the words, ""It couldn't be just coincidence."" Today the explanation many people reach for involves mental telepathy or psychic stirrings. But should we leap so readily into the arms of a mystic realm? Could such events result from coincidence after all?  There are two features of coincidences not well known among the public. First, we tend to overlook the powerful reinforcement of coincidences, both waking and in dreams, in our memories. Non-coincidental events do not register in our memories with nearly the same intensity. Second, we fail to realize the extent to which highly improbable events occur daily to everyone. It is not possible to estimate all the probabilities of many paired events that occur in our daily lives. We often tend to assign coincidences a lesser probability than they deserve.   However, it is possible to calculate the probabilities of some seemingly improbable events with precision. These examples provide clues as to how our expectations fail to agree with reality.

       urlLink The journalism and films of John Pilger  On 2 August 1990 the Iraqi army invaded its southern neighbour, Kuwait. Four days later the United Nations responded by imposing a complete trade embargo on Iraq. In the ten years since Iraq has continued to be the subject of sanctions that affect almost every aspect of life for the average woman, man and child.   With imports of food and medicine severely restricted, malnutrition and disease is now endemic in what was once one of the healthiest countries in the world. A 1999 Unicef report calculated that more than half a million children had died as a direct result of sanctions. On average 200 hundred Iraqi children are dying every day.   In September 1998, Denis Halliday head of the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq resigned claiming he could no longer administer 'an immoral and illegal' policy. His successor, Hans von Sponeck also later resigned, along with the head of the World Food Programme.   Meanwhile US and UK politicians insist that the sanctions regime is necessary to contain the threat of Saddam Hussein. When asked on US television whether the death of 500,000 Iraqi children as a result of sanctions was justified Madelaine Albright replied 'I think this is a very hard choice, but the price - we think the price is worth it.'

        Bees invade the internet   By BBC News Online internet reporter Mark Ward  Soon software that acts like bees or ants could be running the internet.   Researchers at the University of California are claiming that we need radically new ways to run the net as more and more people and devices go online.   Michael Wang and Tatsuya Suda say that existing methods of keeping the net going will not be able to cope when billions of people, mobile phones, hand-held computers and household appliances are routinely using it to communicate.   What is needed, claim the pair, are self-organising systems inspired by biology.   The researchers are experimenting with discrete programs called agents that have been modelled on bees and ants.   Individually these insects are very stupid but put enough of them together and they do a very efficient job of running and maintaining huge structures like nests and hives without any central control.   By contrast, current internet management systems tend to be very centralised and directed by people.   Mr Wang says that this set-up will be unable to cope when everything from our PCs to refrigerators is online.   No-one will have the time or inclination to ensure that all the devices are doing what they should, he says.   ""The devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things,"" says Mr Wang.   Many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them.   When Sir Paul McCartney did a webcast of a performance at the Cavern in Liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show.   Under the scheme proposed by the US researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it.   Mr Wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source. The bees ""die"" when users stop requesting clips.   Belgian scientist Marco Dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet. But he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people.   The bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do.   This rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the Lord of the Rings movie currently being filmed in New Zealand.   The troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed.   Battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action.

       Iceland launches energy revolution  By environment correspondent Tim Hirsch  In 1874 the science fiction writer Jules Verne envisaged a world in which water would replace coal as the fuel of the future.   Now the Icelanders believe they can turn that dream into reality within a generation - and they are taking the first steps next year in their project to create the world's first hydrogen society.   Iceland has already gone further than any other country in exploiting its abundant sources of renewable energy. Virtually all of its electricity and heating comes from hydroelectric power and the geo-thermal water reserves tapped from the hot rock layers lying just beneath the surface of this extraordinary island.

       urlLink Are We Not Geeks?     Tolkien and his keen readers are often criticised for being stuck in eternal adolescence, and labelled as geeks. I'd like to take a closer look at these labels.   Consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they're want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals. Many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one's 'inner child.' The inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world. Well and good; evidently the ""inner child"" is regarded as good and precious. But what can we say about the inner adolescent? Why aren't we nurturing the inner adolescent?   I think you can hardly say the phrase 'teenager' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one's own years of irritable awkwardness. We haven't got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should. The author Philip Pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers.   At that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: What is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose? Later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared.   I'd agree with that. I'd go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world's tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... Teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly. As one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest. I think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils.   I'd like to throw in one of the ultimate Romantic poems I've ever come across. It's by an Argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture:   For Afterwards  I would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight.  And in the final instants I would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall.  To die when life is sadly hauling back  its golden nets from out the tide's deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that's lost from sight.  To die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: I am yours although we know so well it will betray us.  Manuel Gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (Translation: Gordon Challis)  Yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose. It is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life. It offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world. It may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness. But would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness? I could not bear the loss.   For this is the inner teenager that Tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to. They are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds.   Nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans. Sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too. Because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not.   The whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too. Other people are involved in writing more about this, but I'll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts. Firstly, what is a geek? Articles like Julian Dibbell's 'Lord of the Geeks' article on Village Voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they're some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world. They're losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media. (And I might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.)   My own definition of geeks is this: A geek cares about a subject or system so much that they're willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not. The link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they're absorbed in play. It's only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there's some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising. Instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they'd rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the Plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin. Sometimes they're fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they've found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they'll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks.   The larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame. In their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else. Geeks resist that because, well, it'd mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity.   There's always been geeks. Mozart? What a nerd! He had to be a geek. Who illuminated medieval manuscripts? Who preserved literacy during the difficult, violent centuries of the Dark Ages? Geek monks who remembered what civilisation was! Who were Pythagoras and Socrates and Archimedes? Total geeks every one of them, with their heads in the clouds.   And so I ask, if anything worth doing is to be done: Are we not geeks?   written by tehanu@theonering.net

      Japan Scientists Grow Artificial Eyeball -Kyodo TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese scientists have succeeded in growing artificial eyeballs for the first time in the world, Kyodo news agency said Saturday.  A group of researchers led by Makoto Asashima, biology professor at Tokyo University, succeeded in growing eyeballs in tadpoles using cells taken from frog embryos, Kyodo said.  ``Since the basics of body-making is common to that of human beings, I think this might help enable people to regain vision in the future,'' Asashima was quoted as saying.  The group, after soaking undifferentiated cells from the embryo of a Platanna frog in a special medium, transplanted the eyeball into a tadpole whose left eye had been removed before it was hatched, Kyodo said.  A week after the transplant, Asashima's group confirmed the tadpole's eyeball was connected to the optic nerves and there were no rejection symptoms, it said.   http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020105/sc/japan_eyeball_dc_1.html

       urlLink Turkish women get equal rights  The new year sees the start of a quiet revolution in Turkish society, when centuries of legally enshrined inequality between the sexes are brought to an end.   From 1 January, Turkish men are no longer regarded by law as the head of the family. These latest measures included in sweeping reforms to the country's civil code are described by Turkey's Justice Minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, as the result of no less than 50 years' hard work.   Women are now legally allowed to take a job without first seeking their spouse's permission, and their husbands no longer have the right to decide unilaterally where a couple will live.   But by far the most significant element of the new legislation is the provision that married women are entitled to an equal share of joint assets in the event of divorce.

Some factories like Lichfield also add or remove protein to obtain a desired protein level. It is then pasteurised and transferred to tanks where starter culture and a rennet enzyme is added.  Curdling Rennet, usually obtained from the stomach of calves, reacts with the casein protein in the milk to convert it into curd, the main element of cheese. This curd also contains a large proportion of whey, a watery substance full of sugar.

       urlLink ENFP under stress  ENFP  ENFPs have a tendency to overextend themselves in both their physical and emotional commitments. Their proclivity to procrastinate and to overlook details complicates their circumstances. ENFPs often move on to new ventures without completing those they have already started. Their charming personalities can show signs of irritability and over-sensitivity when their desires to please different people come into conflict. During times of stress, ENFPs feel alienated. They then engage in deceptions that serve to obscure what is occurring within themselves.  The ENFP finds symbolic meanings behind the immediate circumstances. These meanings are construed as foreboding problems when ENFPs are under stress. Having a pervasive feeling of losing control over their own independent identities, ENFPs will feel virtually split apart by intruding circumstances. They will be ""besides themselves"" and ""just not all there""  as if something, or someone, has taken away the essence of who they are. Not feeling like themselves, the ENFP will become subject to their own feelings of shame for being a phony, a fake or an impostor. If stress continues to grow, they may attribute malevolent schemes to others in order to explain away their fears.

       urlLink Conflicting relations   These are relations of constantly developing conflict. Conflicting relations have the worst compatibility between partners among all other relations. However, it does not seem to be so obvious, especially in the earlier stages of development. Conflicting partners appear rather attractive, interesting and with impressive abilities.   Both partners are usually convinced that they can coexist and collaborate quite peacefully, but soon it becomes apparent that something is always going wrong, making their relationship problematic. Both partners may mistakenly think that the cause of these problems is minor and easily fixed and that all they need to do is to show a little bit more effort in understanding their partner.   Unfortunately, these attempts to continue pushing their relationship any further will soon provoke an open conflict between the partners. When conflict starts, partners hit each other with arguments exactly in the direction where they can cause maximum pain. In return, the other partner may counterattack even more aggressively. With every conflict these relations become worse and worse.   Although Conflicting partners show confidence where their partner is unconfident, they are unable to protect and take care of each other's weak points. This regularly brings disagreement and disappointment into these relations. When after several fruitless attempts to establish a stable relationship the partners give up and break the relationship, they feel saved and released.   ISTj - ENFp

One of the Ohio-based company's t-shirts reads ""Wong Brothers Laundry Service -- Two Wongs Can Make It White"" and shows two smiling men with slanted eyes wearing conical hats.   Abercrombie said the shirts were supposed to be funny and cater to Asian customers.   ""We personally thought Asians would love this T-shirt,"" said Hampton Carney, a spokesman for the company.   The T-shirts prompted a late-night meeting of Stanford University students Wednesday. The Asian American Students' Association encouraged calls to the company, and said Abercrombie & Fitch should apologize.   ""It's really misleading as to what Asian people are,"" said Michael Chang, vice chairman of the student organization. ""The stereotypes they depict are more than a century old. You're seeing laundry service. You're seeing basically an entire religion and philosophy being trivialized.""   One shirt features a smiling Buddha figure with the slogan ""Abercrombie and Fitch Buddha Bash -- Get Your Buddha on the Floor"". Another shirt reads ""Wok-N-Bowl -- Let the Good Times Roll -- Chinese Food & Bowling.""   Abercrombie apologised for the offense caused after the first protest broke out.

       urlLink SELF-HELP: Divorce  DIVORCE: A Crisis, Any Way You Look At It   If you are currently facing the realities of a divorce--either as a partner in a failing marriage, or as a child of parents whose marriage is ending--you are not alone. More than two and one-half million adults divorce every year; and more than a million children become children of divorced parents.   Divorce is a CRISIS of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes. According to the dictionary, a ""crisis"" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur. That is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so. In fact, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning DANGER and OPPORTUNITY. The process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.   The dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--LOSS. Whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce. Recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.   It is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma. Reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror. In these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.   A later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning. Feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression. Again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate. It is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.   The dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense. For children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it. This loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster. Furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings. Thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss. To help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect. They need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs. They need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage. They need structure and routine and consistency. Finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling. And they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.   As stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity. Once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce. The crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings. it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment. At this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience. Through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life. For many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.   For most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous. There are many books available to assist you in these challenges. Two useful ones are Divorcing by Kranzler and Belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and How to Survive the Loss of a Love by Colgrove, Bloomfiled and McWilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general). Also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce. Consult with the Counseling Center in Shoemaker Hall (314-7651) or the Mental Health Clinic in the Health Center (314-8106). They offer support and help.     The author, Kathy Zamostny, is a staff psychologist at the University Counseling Center.

       urlLink   THE FOUR EMOTIONAL STAGES OF DIVORCE WORK by Phil Rich, Ed.D., MSW. The End of Marriage   The hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence. Accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting.   Divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners. Regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss.   Divorce is composed of both ""technical"" and ""emotional"" aspects. The technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process. But the ""other"" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath. This is ""divorce work"" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce.    The Emotional Stages of Divorce  Although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they're not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time. At this difficult time, it can help to understand what's typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they're likely to experience, and in what order. These are the ""emotional"" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through.   The necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include:  facing the reality of the divorce  working through painful feelings  experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage  coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss  adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life    Stage 1:  ""Shock and Disbelief"" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in. It involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through.  Facing reality  Self esteem and inadequacy  Telling the world  Support and help    Stage 2:  ""Initial Adjustment"" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives. The primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include:  Functioning and responsibility  Practical reality  Legal Matters  Managing emotions    Stage 3:  ""Active Re-organization"" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single. Major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include:  Managing life style and practical affairs  Re-defining relationships  Reconstructing personal values and beliefs  Concluding legal procedures    Stage 4:  ""Life Re-formation"" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the ""other"" side of their divorce. During this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives.  Constructing relationships  New interests  Personal responsibility  Accepting your new life    Summary and Conclusion  The first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly. It's the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over. The second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce. The final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life. This stage really has no formal ""end,"" and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional.   Of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap. And things aren't as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next. But helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them.   References:  Burns B., & Whiteman, T.

       urlLink   Question: You've discussed briefly some of the physiological and emotional differences between the sexes. Could you list other physical characteristics unique to males and females?   Dr. Dobson Responds:  Men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren't even conscious of. Here are just a few of those differences:   1. A woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern. Normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the U.S. Females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus. More than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.159   2. Men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.160   3. Men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.161   4. The sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk. The first finger of a woman's hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true. Boys' teeth last longer than do those of girls.162   5. Women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.163   6. Women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. Each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly. Female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied. The glands work differently in the two sexes. For example, a woman's thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty. Women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.164   7. Women's blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells). Since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint. Her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter. When the working day in British factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.165   8. Men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.166   9. Women's hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute). Their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.167   10. Female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.168   11. Women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.169   12. Men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern. The implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle. For example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways. The young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top. Women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170   Who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness?

      Subject: Story for you.... Date: Mon, 9 Sep 2002 19:27:36 -0600 From: Jafree To: Heather   Uniqueness  Beyond superiority and inferiority  Every human being is unique. There is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior. Yes, people are different.   Let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I am not saying that everybody is equal. Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life, you have to contribute your potential to life. I have to discover my own being, you have to discover your own being.  When inferiority disappears, all feeling of superiority also disappears. They live together, they cannot be separated. The man who feels superior is still feeling inferior somewhere. The man who feels inferior wants to feel superior somewhere. They come in a pair; they are always there together; they cannot be separated.   It happened... A very proud man, a warrior, a samurai, came to see a Zen master. The samurai was very famous, well known all over the country, But looking at the master, looking at the beauty of the master and the grace of the moment, he suddenly felt inferior. Maybe he had come with an unconscious desire to prove his superiority. He said to the master ""Why am I feeling inferior? Just a moment ago, everything was okay. As I entered into your court suddenly I felt inferior. I have never felt like that. My hands are shaking. I am a warrior, I have faced death many times, and I have never felt any fear--why am I feeling frightened?""   The master said, ""You wait. When everybody has gone, I will answer."" People continued coming to visit the master, and the man was getting tired, more and more tired. By the evening the room was empty, there was nobody, and the samurai said, ""Now, can you answer it?"" And the master said, ""Now, come outside.""   A full moon night--the moon was just rising on the horizon... And he said, ""Look at these trees, this tree high in the sky and this small tree. They both have existed by the side of my window for years, and there has never been any problem. The smaller tree has never said, 'Why do I feel inferior before you?' to the big tree. How is it possible? This tree is small, and that tree is big, and I have never heard any whisper.""   The samurai said, ""Because they can't compare.""   The master said, ""Then you need not ask me; you know the answer.""   Comparison brings inferiority, superiority. When you don't compare, all inferiority, all superiority, disappear. Then you are, you are simply there. A small bush or a big high tree--it doesn't matter; you are yourself. You are needed. A grass leaf is needed as much as the biggest star. Without the grass leaf God will be less than he is. The sound of the cuckoo is needed as much as any Buddha; the world will be less, will be less rich if the cuckoo disappears.   Just look around. All is needed, and everything fits together. It is an organic unity: nobody is higher and nobody is lower, nobody superior, nobody inferior. Everybody is incomparably unique.

       urlLink Haiku For Beginners    I guess the first thing you noticed is that they're short - two or three lines only. There are not many words in those lines either. And you didn't hear rhymes, did you?   Beyond their physical form, these poems obviously have something else in common. It is something to do with the subject matter and the direct method of presentation. If we had time to discuss it we could refine that thought until we had something like this.   The poems speak  - about experience from the senses  - directly and with intensity  - about observation of nature   They seek to construct a clear and significant image in our minds or perhaps to juxtapose or contrast two such images. Usually it is an image from nature or from daily life. Perhaps though, to say that the poem 'constructs' the image in our mind is a bad way of saying it. Really the poem is reminding us of something we've already seen, heard or felt. That's how they manage to conjure up so complex an image with so few words. One possibility is to go with what you know now.   Let me first remind you of the rules I've already given you. The poem should be start with an image or a pair if them. It should be direct from sense experience, without metaphor, simile or rhyme. Haiku is of course a traditional Japanese form with further strict rules of construction. Not all are honoured outside Japan and even there some are defiantly broken. To what I've already stated let me add three more stipulations.   three lines with 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5  one kigo or season word  one kireji or cutting word   The first rule is the most well known and it is the one most mentioned by writers on the subject of haiku. The idea is simple. Write a line of five syllables, follow it with a seven-syllable line and then use five syllables to make the final line. This gives you two short lines divided by a longer one. It goes a long way to guiding the method of expression in the poem.   There is a good deal of controversy about this rule; but let's skip that for the moment and talk about the third. The kireji or cutting word is used to divide the haiku into two parts. Obviously this should be used to enhance the juxtaposition of images we discussed earlier. In English the tendency is to use punctuation, such as ""-"" or "":"" to perform this function.   The second rule that requires the use of a kigo or season word helps establish the season or time of year that the poem describes. For English-language haiku this rule is taken to remind the writer that the poem should be grounded in nature.   But most important is that the form isn't the goal here. It's to write a good poem. So the exercise of writing haiku oneself is very important. Occasional reading and discussion on the form, tradition and history of haiku and reading others' haiku all help to feed the writing with new ideas and approaches.

The cores also yielded remarkable evidence of three catastrophic droughts that plagued the tropics 8,300, 5,200 and 4,000 years ago. Lastly, the analysis also supports Ohio State University researchers' prediction that these unique bodies of ice will disappear in the next two decades, the victims of global warming.

       urlLink A Summary of the Twelve Houses   The Twelve  houses of the horoscope define twelve areas of our life.  The beginning of each of the houses is called the cusp.  Each house has what is called a natural sign and natural ruling planets.  This is the sign and planet which are associated with that house in the natural chart beginning with Aries and ending with Pisces.  The Astrodienst charts show another division of the houses.  This division places the houses in groups that are on the angles, the angular (ang); houses that follow immediately behind each angular house, the succedent (suc) houses, and the third in line, the cadent (cad) houses. There are four each, angular, succedent, and cadent houses. Older books taught that planets in the angular houses were somewhat stronger and planets in the cadent houses were weaker in influence. Now little attention is paid to this idea.

       Osho Zen Tarot   Patience                        We have forgotten how to wait; it is almost an abandoned space. And it is our greatest                       treasure to be able to wait for the right moment. The whole existence waits for the right                       moment. Even trees know it--when it is time to bring the flowers and when it is time to let go                       of all the leaves and stand naked against the sky. They are still beautiful in that nakedness,                       waiting for the new foliage with a great trust that the old has gone, and the new will soon be                       coming, and the new leaves will start growing. We have forgotten to wait, we want                       everything in a hurry. It is a great loss to humanity.... In silence and waiting something inside                       you goes on growing--your authentic being. And one day it jumps and becomes a flame, and                       your whole personality is shattered; you are a new man. And this new man knows what                       ceremony is, this new man knows life's eternal juices.                         There are times when the only thing to do is to wait. The seed has been planted, the child is                       growing in the womb, the oyster is coating the grain of sand and making it into a pearl. This  card reminds us that now is a time when all that is required is to be simply alert, patient, waiting. The woman pictured here is  in just such an attitude. Contented, with no trace of anxiety, she is simply waiting. Through all the phases of the moon  passing overhead she remains patient, so in tune with the rhythms of the moon that she has almost become one with it. She  knows it is a time to be passive, letting nature take its course. But she is neither sleepy nor indifferent; she knows it is time to  be ready for something momentous. It is a time full of mystery, like the hours just before the dawn. It is a time when the only  thing to do is to wait.

       urlLink Robert E. Wilkinson 's The Quantum Brahman   In their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world's leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe. Scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact. The first of these categories is the Gravitational Force. It is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force. The gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the Sun, Moon and Planets. The second category is the Electromagnetic Force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles. While it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another. The third category called the Weak Nuclear Force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos. In 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism. It is now called the Electro-weak force. The fourth category, called the Strong Nuclear Force, binds particles together into combinations. Matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks. The strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.   While these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe. This problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification. Their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the Luminiferous Ether. It was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances. To the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions. But, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the Etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field. Leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation. Since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the Quantum Vacuum. However, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the Quantum Vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe. Scientists now agree that it was the Quantum Vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe. And they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum. A number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a Grand Unified Field Formula.   The discovery of the Quantum Vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon. Physicists cautiously agree that the Quantum Vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter. There is even a growing consensus among scientists that Vacuum Physics lie at the core of everything. But, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the Quantum Vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go. They have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable. The laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.   In order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the Quantum Vacuum and measure the density of the Transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of Time. For Time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter. For centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that Time was a derivative of Space even to the point of calling it 'Space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; Time is what gives birth to Space.   In his commentaries on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of India's oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, Sri Aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle:   "" ... The [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed. (Time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.) From the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal. Time in its period is the Self of the Horse Sacrificial, so not Matter but Time, is the body of this force of the material universe... Space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of Time which the sage attributes to his Horse of the worlds, by movement in Space its periods are shaped and determined. Hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the Horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of Space, but the magnitudes of Time... for Time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in Space possible.""   Sri Aurobindo, The Upanishads; 'The Great Aranyaka', Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, 1971  In the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest. They may exist in Being but not in Time. They are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of Time. For it is Saturn/Chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the Supreme Godhead into material form.   In its native state, the Absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; One without a second. In order for the Incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible. It does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms. It manifests first as Cosmic and Planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain. Through this alchemical process, the Absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated Unity into Form and Multiplicity. This act of contraction, is the basis upon which the Greek myths portray Saturn/Chronos as having dismembered his father.   In order to break the code of the Transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy. It must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach. Scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality. Fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because Cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order.   One of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, David Bohm in his book, Wholeness and the Implicate Order. Using the language of mathematics, Bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the Explicate Order.   ""The Explicate Order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the Implicate order. It is the precursor of the Explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object. The Implicate order implies within it all physical universes. However, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential. It is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order. Bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence. The creative process springs from this realm. Energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order.""   Will Keepin, David Bohm, Noetic Science Journal  When Bohm's resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality.   The Zero Point Order which Bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of Indian metaphysics known as the Brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as Absolute Being. Realization of the Brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of Time and Consciousness which we experience as Timelessness, or undifferentiated Time. In this state Time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness. Hence it cannot produce any form or any division of Consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in Space.   In the language of physics the Brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as Emptiness or a Void. It appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases. The amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line. In this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said. Bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power. His calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this Zero Point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe.   Bohm's work with Zero Point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the Absolute or Brahman becomes manifest in Time and Space. And while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like Sri Aurobindo, Bohm's discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits Emptiness or a Void as the highest spiritual realization.   ""Nothing can arise from Nothing. Asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, ""Here there is nothing."" Out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero. But what in truth is this zero? It is an incalculable Infinite... Our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness. In truth there is nothing but Light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision's limited range.""  Sri Aurobindo, The Web of Yoga, Centenary Edition, Vol. 17, p. 48  Bohm's breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish Fullness rather than a Void as the ground state of the universe. The implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of Spirit and Matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter.   While these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of Vedic India. Long ago the Rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the Etheric Plenum, or Fullness from which all things emerge. According to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that Etheric Plenum. The Atharva Veda describes that point or seed as an 'Embryo [Hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.' This embryo or seed lies at the intersection of Time and Space, Spirit and Matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution. In the language of scientific cosmology, this point or Seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being. In metaphysical terms it is the Luminiferous Ether, the OM or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin. All material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time. Once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the Seer to follow the evolving in our Time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction.   Knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the Vedic Rishis because It allowed them to follow the unfolding of that Seed and 'See' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality. They were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the Transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line. This knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the Rig Veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over. The Seer became displaced by the Nirvani as emphasis shifted from Gnosis to a philosophy of Illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a Transcendent consciousness. As a result of this development, the bridge between the Transcendent and the Physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant. It was understood that the Brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the All was once again a great mystery.   ""When the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence. More importantly, that essence itself became deformed. The experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth. This was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on Earth. Above all, creation became divested of true sacredness.""   Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The Vishaal Newsletter, October, 1988  Today, some two thousand years later, Science and Spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that Truth or Salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or Nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit. The influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven Science and Spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence. The key to that paradigm is a new understanding of Time and its primary role bridging the Transcendent and the Physical world.   ""It cannot be denied that Time is a major feature of our material universe. In consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, Time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go 'beyond time', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate Time. Conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of Time. Furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which Time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation.""   Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The New Way, Vol. 3, 1983  In the early 1970's Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, the world's leading authority on Vedic Cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries. She had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient India evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture. The Rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends. Their knowledge of Time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient Yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as Truth-Consciousness or Swar of the Veda. The Rishis understood that the Cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form. They also knew that the difference between man/woman and the Cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the Macrocosm and Microcosm had a correspondent equivalence. Through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the Cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world. Since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the Macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life. If man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of Cosmic Time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience. Since the same Zero Womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this Soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of Truth-Consciousness or Gnosis.   This was the essence of the Rig Vedic Yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970's by Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet. From the principles of these ancient teachings, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, The Gnostic Circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos.   ""The Gnostic Circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system. The Circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the Circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of Earth life. The joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the Spirit. In fact we can say that the Gnostic Circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind.""   Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet ,The Gnostic Circle, p. 159, 1975  Ms. Norelli-Bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of Time and Measure. Her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of Time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of Time as the integrative mechanism by which a Divine purpose is expressed in the world. Her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material Reality which include the Being as well as the dynamics of the Becoming of that same Being. ""Time"", says Norelli-Bachelet, ""is the vehicle, the medium for the Absolute or Supreme Consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the Spiritual and Physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the Supreme within the physical manifestation .""   In Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's Cosmology, the Zero Womb or what science is now calling the Quantum Vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the Sun or primary Axis of our own Universe. The nine planets which orbit about the Sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that Zero/Womb/Axis. The planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called Cabalistic Reduction. Since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of Number and relate the movement of the spheres to the Calendar which measures time periods on earth. Through this system of cosmic harmonies, the Gnostic Circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between Time and Space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.   By unveiling the Quantum Brahman or body of the Absolute, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the Zero Womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form. She has rebuilt the bridge between Spirit and Matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order. Through the use of her Gnostic Circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that Implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the Explicate universe. Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality.   2/12/96   Robert E.

       urlLink No-Shame, No-Blame Creation Story   by Clare Puskarczyk   In the beginning...  there was an entity of light  within a lovely garden  which was also made of light.  A single being, with many aspects  living in peace and harmony.  When a serpent,  who knew well of matter said,  ""Birth, Death, Rebirth.""  The quality of the light being  that would become known  as the feminine said,  ""Why Not? Exploration, process.""  The masculine energy said,  ""Structure, power.""  And the serpent said,  Be aware, you may forget  who and what you really are.""  She said, ""We'll remember.""  And she said to the masculine energy,  ""I'll remind you of our light.""  And he agreed,  and so they split in two,  into two separate beings,  and the Universe around them  became a duality, And they forgot.  And everything became heavy and  matter now mattered most of all.  Gravity became grave  in its seriousness  and grave as in death,  and they suffered,  and became ill,  and felt lost  and sometimes,  they almost remembered...  something.  and there were times...  when there was joy and light  but always a longing  to get back out of matter.  back to where?  And so they began to learn  how to use matter  and they thought they were powerful  and so a great battle began.  Everyone wanted to have power  power over matter  power over each other  power over thoughts and feelings  power over structures  especially the masculine beings  because their focus was structure.  And they took things apart  and made more...things.   And often...there was fear,  fear of each other,  fear of thoughts & feelings,  fear of the loss of structure.   Structures became institutions  But the feminine beings  were not preoccupied  with the institutions.  Instead they were occupied  with life,  with nature,  with babies  and a different order of things.   Sometimes...  she would remind him  of something,  but he thought he would  lose his power  if he remembered  and so he remained...forgetful.   And for this... he held power over her,  power over nature,  power over his own natural self,  as in control, repression, structure.   Fear kept these beings time-bound  and distanced them  from their light inside,  and their light remained interior  while they took everything apart.   Discovery pulled them forward  until almost everything  large and small  was in pieces.  what they didn't know was that  the external world was becoming  a reflection of themselves,  fragmented selves  with fragmented thoughts,  conflicts unresolved,  split inside.   And the external world  reflected opposites everywhere as in:  Good people don't kill, but...  we must have  war & weapons  to keep our power.  Good people don't lie, but...  we must deny and deceive  to keep our power.  Good people don't harm, but...  we must argue and abuse  to keep our power.   Yet behind all of this  there was still light,  and there were  those who would remember  something  and living differently  some of them stood out  as heroes...strangely enough.   Finally...  after many thousands of years,  when the world was full of  war and weapons,  denial and deception  and abuse of every kind,  and matter had contracted  as far as it could go,  little sparks of light  began to flash  more & more often  and remembering  began to manifest as:  concern for the environment,  conflict resolution,  love for one another  with integration and wholeness  bringing the fragments  back together.   Now...  individuals were creating community,  scientists discovering quantum leaps,  spiritual psychology learning  and teaching empowerment,  and the lights became brighter still.   Soon there were those  who remembered very well  that power was indeed interior,  that everything was made of light,  that evil meant  to live backwards in fear, and  that trust had  the vibrational quality  to bring light forward.   And that everyone together  had been Making it all up!   Even still...  people seemed to take sides.  And in the end,  those full of light  looked at those full of fear  and saw their light hidden inside  and loved them.   And those full of fear  looked at those full of love  and saw their light  and remembered their own,  and they all remembered together  and began to lighten up.  And soon  they found themselves  at home again... Back in the garden.

       urlLink You Create Your World   This chapter excerpt is from the book Hermes Reality Creator I. It is © copyright 1999-2003 by Hermes Trismegistus. Please follow the copyright link for additional copyright information. Or go to one of the following links for final version copies or Reality Creator Books & Supplies. http://www.wisdomsdoor.com / http://www.realitycreatorbooks.com  Note: This chapter is an exact copy of the printed book version!  I think - therefore I am  You create your world! No other concept possesses the power that this idea does. Think about it? The power to change your world rests within yourself  within your mind!    Thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities. This physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise. When you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create. You make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want. Remember! You have a right to create your own world.    That right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers  divine powers, we might add  who cherish that right themselves. They would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you. Except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation.    To reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess. Doing both will take time. However, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation.    To begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you cant control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control. Along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness. Your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality.    Learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process. Good reality-control comes from within, not without. An uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal. This untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires. All these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation. Except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast. When a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beasts world. This haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid. Your consciousnesss driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants.    Now, to help make our point, lets take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness.      Does you mind wander regularly  jumping from topic to topic? In other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items? Anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering. Mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast.   Do you continually look on the negative side of things? A negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness  not you! Emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating. However, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over. Emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within.   Do you often feel mentally drained? Continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation. With inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life. If you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you. Poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you.   Do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation? Not knowing how a device operates  especially an inner device  can greatly hinder your ability to use it. A computer is no good if you havent a clue how to operate it! Thought-creation is the same. Your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world. Otherwise, youll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone. While the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days. So, if you dont understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level.    Im sure many of you answered yes to some of these questions. Answering yes does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned. Being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources. Because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity. You must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others.    With a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life. For one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you. You will create the world you want and need. There will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute. If you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it. Your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory. You will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time. Plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations. When an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you. You will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny.    You create your world! No other statement is more true. Now it is your job to learn how. Take the first step toward controlling your reality, and we can help you with the second. Recognize, at least a little, that you can and do have the power to create your world. Youve been doing it for years, since you were born and before. Then, lets take that second step together and learn how to properly use those inner tools  inner tools that will enable you to control the greatest gift in your possession, your own consciousness.      Worksheet Notes:   On the next page is your first worksheet. It is a questionnaire designed to show you your present level of reality creating ability. Please take the time to fill in the questionnaire because the real power in this questionnaire will reveal itself when you come back to it, after youve finished the Hermes Reality Creator I course and retake the test. Your new score will show you how much you have progressed and how much farther you need to work the Reality Creating Game. Each question is designed to alert you to a different area of reality creating skill.   Question one shows you how positively you think about your reality.  Question two shows you how well you can control your lower self, your more base instincts, the animal part of you, if you will.  Question three shows you how well you can keep your mind focused in the present moment.  Question four shows you how well you can regulate your inner power (energy).  Question five shows you how easily you can be coerced by others.   After you take the test, then move on to the next chapter, but keep in mind the areas that you need to work on. As we get to that part of the book, you may want to pay extra attention to that section.

       urlLink Health threat from computer use   Long haul air travel is not the only activity to pose a risk of developing potentially deadly blood clots - sitting at your computer for too long may also put you at risk.   The European Respiratory Journal reports the case of a young man from New Zealand who nearly died after developing deep vein thrombosis following long periods of physical inactivity in front of his computer. It may be similar to the situation with the risk of blood clots with long distance air travel. The man, the first recorded victim of a condition which has been dubbed e-thrombosis, spent up to 18 hours a day using his computer. He developed a massive blood clot that formed in his leg veins, broke off and travelled to his lungs.   Although the controversy about long-haul air travel has recently put DVT in the headlines, the condition was first described in people sitting on deckchairs in air raid shelters during the Blitz in London.

       urlLink QuitNet QuitGuide  Physical Addiction Within just 7-10 seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine begins affecting your brain.  Nicotine acts on cells in the reward center of the brain.  This results in feelings of pleasure and alertness- the ""hit"" that your body comes to expect.  When bloodstream nicotine levels are at their peak, the brain is highly stimulated.  However, within just 30 minutes, your body has cleaned out most of the nicotine.  You then feel tired, jittery, depressed, or fatigued.  You begin to crave another cigarette, and the cycle continues.  This cycle, which increases in intensity and frequency over time, is part of what makes cigarettes so addictive.   Essentially, smoking becomes a never-ending battle of trying to stay within the comfort zone.

Drink a lot of water and fruit juice.     Don't drink alcohol, coffee, and other beverages that you associate with    smoking.     Strike up a conversation instead of a match for a cigarette.     If you miss the feeling of having a cigarette in your hand, play with    something else - a pencil, a paperclip, a marble.     If you miss the feeling of having something in your mouth, try toothpicks,    cinnamon sticks or celery.     AVOID TEMPTATION by staying away from situations you associate with    pleasurable smoking.     FIND NEW HABITS and create a non-smoking environment around you.     Keep from picking up the habit again by anticipating future    situations/crises that might make you want to smoke again, and remind yourself    of your reasons to not give in.     Take deep rhythmic breaths similar to smoking to relax.     Remember your goal and the fact that the urge will eventually pass.     Think positive thoughts and avoid negative ones.     Brush your teeth.     Do brief bursts of exercise (isometrics, pushups, deep knee bends, walk up    a flight of stairs, or touch your toes).     Call a supportive friend.

       urlLink People with Moon In Virgo  Does this sound like me?   Moon in Virgo Earth Sign   Emotionally spontaneous is not a phrase to describe a Virgoan Moon personality. Like their companion in the Earth signs, Taurus, there isnt the headlong rushing into commitments, either. Virgoan Moons dont overanalyze the relationship as much as they look at the value the relationship may have for themselves. They may hesitate to move at all unless they feel they are on solid ground, or there is some personal advantage to be gained by their emotional involvement.   As lunar Earth sign personalities, those with Moon in Virgo are guarded about their feelings. Virgoan Moons dont much care for discussing openly their emotions as if reporting their portfolio. This is not an ego issue like their neighbor, Leo, as much as it is a ploy to intrigue others to get to know them more intimately. It isnt easy loving a person with a Virgo Moon because they are over-critical in emotional expressions. Believe it or not, this Moon sign may actually be unrealistic at times about their own emotions. Their passion can sometimes be confused with compassion. An over-critical or too analytical approach to emotional situations makes it difficult for them (as well as the others involved) to freely or spontaneously express feelings. Serious-minded, with common sense about most things, they can be surprisingly unrealistic. As a result, they tend to gravitate to situations they know eel rather than explore and be adventuresome with their emotions. This leads Virgoan Moons too often repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result each time and not getting it.  Virgo Moon personalities are emotionally adaptable. They instinctively seem to know what it takes to make others feel better. They make many friends because of their sympathetic nature, but it also means they are vulnerable to being exploited. Though they are not all scholars, they are likely to be fond of books and writing. Intellectual curiosity gives them a penchant for gathering information that can develop into serious research endeavors, or turn out to be just a fondness for gossip. At times they can be overly fastidious, usually with regard to eating habits. Concern with health makes many of them outstanding health care professionals. Their own preoccupation with health can become exaggerated to the point of hypochondria, or they can be guilty of using maladies to attract sympathy. They are mentally and emotionally stimulated by travel, communication, and information.

      Subject: Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr.    Date:  Fri, 17 Jan 2003 13:58:56 -0800    From: ""FAIR""        To:  ""FAIR-L""                                     FAIR-L                     Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting                Media analysis, critiques and activism   Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr.   This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day comes as the U.S. is moving toward war in Iraq. As media prepare to air retrospectives on King, we thought it would be a good time to circulate this 1995 column by FAIR founder Jeff Cohen and FAIR associate Norman Solomon.   ------------------ Media Beat, January 4, 1995 The Martin Luther King You Don't See on TV By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon  It's become a TV ritual: Every year in mid-January, around the time of Martin Luther King's birthday, we get perfunctory network news reports about ""the slain civil rights leader.""  The remarkable thing about this annual review of King's life is that several years-- his last years-- are totally missing, as if flushed down a memory hole.  What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).  An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn't take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.  Almost all of those speeches were filmed or taped. But they're not shown today on TV.  Why?  It's because national news media have never come to terms with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for during his final years.  In the early 1960s, when King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South, most major media were his allies. Network TV and national publications graphically showed the police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods used against Southern blacks who sought the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter.  But after passage of civil rights acts in 1964 and 1965, King began challenging the nation's fundamental priorities. He maintained that civil rights laws were empty without ""human rights""-- including economic rights. For people too poor to eat at a restaurant or afford a decent home, King said, anti-discrimination laws were hollow.  Noting that a majority of Americans below the poverty line were white, King developed a class perspective. He decried the huge income gaps between rich and poor, and called for ""radical changes in the structure of our society"" to redistribute wealth and power.  ""True compassion,"" King declared, ""is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.""  By 1967, King had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic. In his ""Beyond Vietnam"" speech delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- King called the United States ""the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.""  >From Vietnam to South Africa to Latin America, King said, the U.S. was ""on the wrong side of a world revolution."" King questioned ""our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America,"" and asked why the U.S. was suppressing revolutions ""of the shirtless and barefoot people"" in the Third World, instead of supporting them.  In foreign policy, King also offered an economic critique, complaining about ""capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries.""  You haven't heard the ""Beyond Vietnam"" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it. Time magazine called it ""demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi."" The Washington Post patronized that ""King has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.""  In his last months, King was organizing the most militant project of his life: the Poor People's Campaign. He crisscrossed the country to assemble ""a multiracial army of the poor"" that would descend on Washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol, if need be-- until Congress enacted a poor people's bill of rights. Reader's Digest warned of an ""insurrection.""  King's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild America's cities. He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its ""hostility to the poor""-- appropriating ""military funds with alacrity and generosity,"" but providing ""poverty funds with miserliness.""  How familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after King's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet.  As 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the White House and Congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty. And so do most mass media. Perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of Martin Luther King's life.  ------------------ Media Beat is Norman Solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics.

      Nicotine is the addicting chemical in all forms of tobacco. It is a very powerful and dangerous drug - a small child can die from eating just two cigarettes. Nicotine causes the release of brain chemicals, which can give a ""high"" similar to other addicting drugs. It may be as addicting as heroin. The body goes through a physical ""withdrawal"" when the nicotine level drops - causing the ""nicotine fit.""   Nicotine withdrawal can be very unpleasant - many smokers find it difficult to quit due to nicotine addiction. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, craving nicotine, stomach problems, headaches and drowsiness. These symptoms must be addressed for most smokers to successfully become non-smokers.

       urlLink TNT - The Power Within You  From Raphaela on 2/7/2003 11:41:34 AM   Stop bemoaning your fate and get wise to yourself. You have only two choices. You can either go higher or lower. You may take to drink or help yourself to a first-class nervous breakdown or wander around through the rest of your life, moaning about ""what might have been"" if you had only lived your life differently - but telling yourself ""it's too late now"".  But if you belong to that smaller percentage of men and women who have ""gotten wise to themselves"", you discover that it is never too late to get on the right track. You discover that you have been passing up the most wonderful force in your life, the creative power within, which has been ready and willing, at all times, to serve you.  A deep feeling of humility steals over you, and you lose your falsely assumed attitudes of egoism and self-importance forever. Once you are down to bedrock, you find that you have a foundation on which to build, that you can pick up your life again and make something of it, something finer than ever before, perhaps not so flashy or so gaudy, but so much more worthwhile, satisfying, healthful and enjoyable. Now, at last, you can decide what is best for you, without worrying about what the other fellow is going to do to you unless, perhaps, you do it to him first. There has come to you the inner assurance that whatever you need can and will be supplied to you by your creative power, if you keep in attunement with it, and direct it by right mental picturing. Not only this but you realize that you have been missing out on many things in life of far greater value than many of the things you thought you had to have a short time ago.....There is no way out, there is no way back, there is no other way but through.......Claude M. Bristol and Harold Sherman

       urlLink Halliburton subsidiary wins Iraqi oil firefighting contract  WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US army said it gave the main Iraqi oilwell firefighting contract to a unit of Halliburton Co., a firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney without any bidding.   Kellogg, Brown and Root, a unit of Houston, Texas-based Halliburton, was handed the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been placed in charge of fighting the blazes.   The contract had not been put out to tender, said the Corps spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Gene Pawlik.   Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) had already been asked by the Pentagon (news - web sites) to draw up plans for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq (news - web sites), Pawlik noted.   ""It made the most sense to engage them in the near term as the company to get the mission done because they were familiar with the details of the fires themselves and what would be needed,"" he said.   The value of the contract would depend on the scale of the work.   The chief of Britain's armed forces, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, said Friday that Iraqi forces had set fire to seven oil wells in the south of the country.   KBR would claim the cost of its services plus two to five percent depending on how it executed the job, Pawlik said.   ""KBR was selected for this award based on the fact that KBR is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice,"" the company said in a statement.   KBR said it had teams of well control and engineering contractors preparing the initial phase.   The company was given a free hand to choose subcontractors for the work, the Corps spokesman said.   KBR chose Houston-based Boots and Coots International, with which it has a services and equipment partnership, and Wild Well Control Inc. as firefighting subcontractors.   President George W. Bush (news - web sites)'s spokesman, Ari Fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details.   Asked about the contracting process, Fleischer told a news conference: ""The question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires. Refer your question to the agencies involved. I am not familiar with the details of this contract.""   In a statement late Monday, the Defense Department said the Army Corps of Engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities.   Kellogg, Brown and Root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, Pentagon said. The contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said.   ""We have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment,"" Boots and Coots president Brian Krause said in a statement.   ""We will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure,"" he said.   Boots and Coots was brought into Kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the Gulf War (news - web sites), it said.   Cheney was chief executive of the KBR parent company Halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000.

       urlLink PERSONAL MINISTRY: Advancing God's Kingdom  TOOLS OF THE TRADE Message # 4: (Selected Scriptures) Taught by Dr. Larry Osborne North Coast Church January 30 & 31, 1999  As in all families, joining God's family brings with it certain responsibilities. And one of our most important responsibilities is to help advance God's Kingdom. But how can we determine the specific assignment and role God has for us? That's what we'll discover today as we explore the importance of a personal ministry and the special tools called spiritual gifts that make it possible to carry out that ministry.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  FAMILY CHORES    We all have a unique set of God given gifts, skills and resources.   I Corinthians 12:1 & 7/ I Corinthians 4:7/ James 1:17  We are responsible to use them to advance God's Kingdom.    I Peter 4:10-12/ Matthew 25:14-30 & Luke 19:11-27  If we don't use them, we lose them. Advancing God's Kingdom is NOT optional.  The goal is to match what we do best with where we're needed most.             WHAT DO I DO BEST? Discovering Our Spiritual Gift Mix   1) Our spiritual gifts may or may not match our passions and desires.                     Exodus 3:1-4:18/ I Chronicles 26:16-20  You can miss out on what God has for you by pursuing your desires.  2) Giftedness is based upon God's sovereignty not our spirituality.                     Romans 12:6 & I Corinthians 12:4-6/ I Timothy 1:12-16  3) The greater the glory, the less important the gift.       I Corinthians 12:21-26    4) The best way to discover our spiritual gifts is to do something and then check the result.       Matthew 25:14-30, Luke 19:11-27   WHERE AM I NEEDED MOST? Discovering Our God Given Assignment   THREE TOUGH QUESTIONS:  1) Do I have the right paradigm? (viewpoint) Am I looking at this properly? Am I out to win the war or am I being self-indulgent?  2) Do I have the right goal? Is my goal to serve the Lord or is it self fulfillment? Was your service hard or did it just make you feel good?  3) Am I making a real impact?       Matthew 26:36-45  When? Where? How?

       Voyeurism   urlLink War in the digital age: Did you see that?  by Francis Till   Digital technology is bringing the war to the world in new, sometimes astonishingly immediate ways -- and the development is not always welcome.  Anyone caught without a television, for example, can watch a free, live webcast of downtown Bagdhad on a computer screen, 24/7, courtesy BBC News. That link works on internet-capable PDAs, by the way, which can hook up to wireless nets and provide broadband streams to anyone in an 802.11x cloud, even over coffee in a Starbucks anywhere.  Very early monday morning, that camera was trained on a bank of the Tigris river as Iraqi soldiers and police combed the reeds on the shore in search of what was later reported to be two downed American pilots.  The soldiers fired their automatic weapons into the river, violating whatever passes these days for the rules of handling capture, small boats flitted about in the water, angry crowds gathered on the bridge and along the river road.   The audio feed from the camera, which is adequate for loud sounds like traffic and bombs, caught the excited voices of the crowd and even some of the gunfire.  Al Jazeera cameramen were with the soldiers and moments after the webstream fed the images into computers all over the world, very similar pictures began to bloom on television as the Qatar-based station put its images up to satellites.  On BBC webstream 4, the talking heads in the newsroom were taking in the story and beginning to put it out to their global audience. BBC's webstream 4 is a duplicate feed of the news channel's broadcast, with slight variations: at times, it shows presenters during broadcast breaks, for example.  According to the presenters, RAF sources said they could account for all their flights and none were missing. Within 10 minutes, they had quotes from senior officials at the Pentagon making similar statements about American aircraft. Yet, clearly, something was taking place on the banks of the Tigris, where some of the gathered crowd had begun tossing torches into the reeds, hoping to burn the hiding airmen out.  Al Jazeera reported on television at that point that one American pilot had been captured and the crowd was searching for a second airman. According to Al Jazeera, both airmen had been seen parachuting into the river after their airplane had been shot down. Al Jazeera did not use modifiers.  Sky news, at that point, began inserting tag frames onto a picture of the search that quoted US Central Command saying that no coalition planes had been shot down.  On the webstream feed, the sky over Bagdhad began to show as a kind of eerie charcoal grey due to the plumes from burning oil pits, lit earlier in the day in a futile attempt to mask targets from the war planes and missiles.  Meanwhile, the webcam broadcast the sounds of an incoming air attack. Hours before, webcams and television cameras had streamed out images of long range bombers leaving remote bases. Now, they were quite possibly arriving over their target. A target full of civilians, exposed and too far away from shelters to reach what passes for safety in Bagdhad today.  As the crowd began to break up, heading for cover, word came over Sky News from American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that, indeed, a UK warplane, with two pilots, was missing. Not the Tornado shot down earlier by an American Patriot missile, but another.  But then, it was revealed, he was speaking in only general terms, without specific knowlege.  And finally, an astute BBC reporter pointed out that many things -- bombs, equipment -- came down from airplanes in parachutes. Which might explain the conspicuous absence of a crashed airplane.  BBC World News, unfortunately anchored at that mid-afternoon (London time) hour by an earnest second-stringer, reported it by saying that Rumsfeld had said American soldiers were missing and that an ""allied aircraft"" was missing. BBC's on-the-scene reporter had a firmer grasp of events, reminding the somewhat febrile broadcaster of what had been said in Washington only moments before.  To no avail -- because no matter how good the technology becomes, users will absorb only what they are willing to take in.  In America, England, Australia -- the countries flying planes into danger -- families would have been watching the screens of televisions and computers with dread. They were taking everything in, according to the raw testimony of Nancy Chamberlin, the wife of a fallen Marine, who had told NBC anchor Tom Browkaw a day before that she deeply admired what ""all of the new technology is doing today to bring it (the war) into our homes. But for the mothers and the wives who are out there watching it is murder. It's heartbreak. We can't leave the television. Every tank, every helicopter. Is that my son?"" After she hung up the phone, Brokaw broke up on the air. ""War is not about technology,"" he said. ""Behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk,"" LostRemote reported.  And, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to Bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots. And, perhaps, no plane shot down at all.  It's difficult to lie when the cameras are on.  And the cameras are always on, these days.  Even at 50 miles-per-hour.  Spectacular footage from NBC reporter David Bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain. The equipment is from Maritime Telecommunications Network (MTN), of Miramar, Florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed.  But even though it is ALL digital, it's not all cameras.  The websites of Iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online Friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic. The websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds. By Sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the Uruklink sites, and while the Iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to ""live coverage"" was broken.  The Iraqi News Agency site, part of the Uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed. It contains an outdated link to the former website of the Iraq Satellite Channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a Christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime.  According to Brian McWilliams of pc-radio.com, ""Web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching Uruklink.net, the Iraq government's main website, after the US launched its initial attack Wednesday night. But those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of Internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing.  ""In fact, traffic to Uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site. The homepage of Uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today. That would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in December. The previous traffic record occurred on Feb. 9, when the site's address was published in the Drudge Report.""  McWilliams told Politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist Declan McCullagh, that the main Iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country's two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.  We suggest sending email to Saddam.   - www.nbr.co.nz

      Osho Zen Tarot    Trust     Don't waste your life for that which is going to be taken away. Trust life. If you trust, only then can you drop your knowledge, only then can you put your mind aside. And with trust, something immense opens up. Then this life is no longer ordinary life, it becomes full of God, overflowing.   When the heart is innocent and the walls have disappeared, you are bridged with infinity. And you are not deceived; there is nothing that can be taken away from you. That which can be taken away from you is not worth keeping, and that which cannot be taken away from you... why should one be afraid of its being taken away? It cannot be taken away, there is no possibility. You cannot lose your real treasure.  Osho The Sun Rises in the Evening Chapter 9  Commentary:  Now is the moment to be a bungee jumper without the cord! And it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the Knight of Water demands from us.   There is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. And when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don't make any elaborate plans or preparations. We don't say, ""Okay, I trust that I know what to do now, and I'll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me."" No, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next. The leap is the thing, and the thrill of it as we free-fall through the empty sky.   The card gives a hint here, though, about what waits for us at the other end - a soft, welcoming, yummy pink, rose petals, juicy...c'mon!

      Ripeness     Only if your meditation has brought you a light that shines in every night will even death not be a death to you but a door to the divine. With the light in your heart, death itself is transformed into a door, and you enter into the universal spirit; you become one with the ocean. And unless you know the oceanic experience, you have lived in vain. Now is always the time, and the fruit is always ripe. You just need to gather courage to enter into your inner forest. The fruit is always ripe and the time is always the right time. There is no such thing as wrong time.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 6  Commentary:  When the fruit is ripe, it drops from the tree by itself. One moment it hangs by a thread from the branches of the tree, bursting with juice. The next moment it falls--not because it has been forced to fall, or has made the effort to jump, but because the tree has recognized its ripeness and simply let it go. When this card appears in a reading it indicates that you are ready to share your inner riches, your 'juice'. All you need to do is relax right where you are, and be willing for it to happen. This sharing of yourself, this expression of your creativity, can come in many ways--in your work, your relationships, your everyday life experiences. No special preparation or effort on your part is required. It is simply the right time.

       urlLink Courage   The seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed.   Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many.   There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves.   The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed.  Osho Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter 4  Commentary:   This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun.   When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow.   The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them. Be courageous enough to grow into the flower you are meant to be.

       urlLink Osho Zen Tarot 28. Receptivity  Receptivity    Listening is one of the basic secrets of entering into the temple of God. Listening means passivity. Listening means forgetting yourself completely - only then can you listen.   When you listen attentively to somebody, you forget yourself. If you cannot forget yourself, you never listen. If you are too self-conscious about yourself, you simply pretend that you are listening - you don't listen. You may nod your head; you may sometimes say yes and no, but you are not listening.   When you listen, you become just a passage, a passivity, a receptivity, a womb: you become feminine. And to arrive one has to become feminine. You cannot reach God as aggressive invaders, conquerors. You can reach God only...or it will be better to say God can reach you only when you are receptive, a feminine receptivity. When you become yin, a receptivity, the door is open - and you wait. Listening is the art for becoming passive.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 5  Commentary:  Receptivity represents the feminine, receptive quality of water and of the emotions. Her arms are extended upwards to receive, and she is completely immersed in the water. She has no head, no busy and aggressive mind to hinder her pure receptivity. And as she is filled she is continuously emptying herself, overflowing, and receiving more. The lotus pattern or matrix that emerges from her represents the perfect harmony of the universe that becomes apparent when we are in tune with it.   The Queen of Water brings a time of unboundedness and gratitude for whatever life brings, without any expectations or demands. Neither duty or thought of merit or reward are important. Sensitivity, intuition and compassion are the qualities that shine forth now, dissolving all the obstacles that keep us separate from each other and from the whole.

       urlLink Weekly Review - May 27, 2003: Harper's Magazine  The United States and several other countries banned Canadian beef after a mad cow was discovered in Alberta. Officials were quick to point out that there was no evidence that beef from the cow, which was slaughtered in January, had entered the food chain, although they admitted that the carcass had been sent to a rendering plant and that the protein produced by the plant is sometimes used in pet food. ""I want to stress from the beginning this is one cow,"" said the minister of agriculture. ""Don't try to leave the impression that this animal went into the feed chain."" Last year more than 500,000 head of cattle were exported from Alberta to the United States. Prime Minister Jean Chretien made a public show of eating a steak. SARS continued to spread in Toronto, and Britain's foreign office told travelers to avoid Taiwan because of the continuing outbreak there. The SARS virus was found in six masked palm civit cats and in a raccoon dog; SARS antibodies were also found in a Chinese ferret badger. Investigators said it was probable that the virus had jumped from one of the Chinese delicacies to humans. A new television channel devoted exclusively to SARS opened in Singapore. A British man who walked alone to the North Pole was sitting there waiting for somebody to come give him a ride home, and a 70-year-old Japanese man climbed Mount Everest. A wild turkey was found perched on a 28th-floor balcony in Manhattan.   American intelligence officials decided that two trailers found in Iraq were used to manufacture bioweapons even though they had found no evidence that the trailers were used for that purpose. Bush Administration officials claimed to have ""rock-hard intelligence"" that an Al Qaeda cell operating in Iran had directed the recent bombings in Saudi Arabia. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, was asked to describe the role played by the Iranian cell; he said he knew but wasn't ""going to get into it. That's for others to do."" State Department officials revealed that the administration was planning to destabilize the Iranian government; others were more worried about the Al Qaeda cells in Saudi Arabia said to be plotting new attacks. American interrogators were forcing Iraqi prisoners to listen to songs by the rock band Metallica  as well as the ""Sesame Street"" theme song and the ""I Love You"" song by Barney the purple dinosaur  in order to make them talk. ""These people haven't heard heavy metal. They can't take it,"" said one Psy Ops officer. ""If you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. That's when we come in and talk to them."" The Pentagon announced that it was changing the name of the Total Information Awareness project to ""Terrorist Information Awareness."" The program will search for data patterns that suggest terrorist activity; the project is also funding research into ""human kinematics"" and ""gait recognition,"" apparently so that terrorists can be identified by their ""walking style."" It occurred to several prominent Democratic senators that the president might have deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq in order to scare people into supporting an invasion. Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said he believed that weapons of mass destruction would be found, but added that ""basically, you have a real credibility problem"" if they are not. Former Iraqi soldiers were beginning to get restless; about 50 demonstrated in Basra and demanded that their salaries be paid by the occupiers: ""If they don't pay us, we'll start problems,"" said one. ""We have guns at home. If they don't pay us, if they make our children suffer, they'll hear from us."" Members of the Arab Saraefien tribe near the Iranian border were also threatening to take up arms. ""The Americans promised us food and medicine and freedom. But we have lost our homes, our land, our crops. Now we live in prison with nothing, and they ignore us,"" said Hadeb Hamed Hamed, the tribe's sheikh. ""If we don't have a solution, we will fight the Americans even if they kill us. It is better than sitting here with nothing and just dying."" In Morocco, a satirist was sentenced to four years in prison for ""insulting the king"" and ""undermining the monarchy."" The Dixie Chicks were booed at the Academy of Country Music Awards.   Christine Todd Whitman resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and said that President Bush had been ""hurt"" by his inability to explain his environmental policies. The House of Representatives voted to exempt the Pentagon from environmental laws that protect animals such as the tidewater goby fish, the Arroyo toad, the San Diego fairy shrimp, and the coastal California gnatcatcher. Governor Jeb Bush of Florida signed a bill that could delay the restoration of the Everglades for ten years. The town of Sublimity, Oregon, was trying to sell its old unwanted water tower on Ebay. The Republican Party was selling lunch with Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, to anyone who can raise $50,000, and the Center for Public Integrity reported that Federal Communications Commission officials have taken more than two thousand trips to tourist destinations such as Las Vegas and New Orleans that were paid for by media and telecommunications companies. It was reported that Republican fund-raisers who bring in at least $200,000 for the 2004 campaign will be called ""Rangers""; those who bring in $100,000 get to be called ""Pioneers."" The number of Christians who tithe was down 62 percent compared with last year.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Iraqis Test Newfound Press Freedoms  Mon May 19, 9:37 AM ET  Add World - AP to My Yahoo!    By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer   BAGHDAD, Iraq - On one street in the capital, a vendor shouts out news he would have been arrested for trumpeting just weeks ago: ""Read all about Saddam's double!"" A woman skids her car to a stop and asks for a copy of Assaah, a newspaper published in Iraq without government supervision.   Iraqis are now enjoying media freedoms unheard of in the eight decades since the nation was established by British colonialists.   During the last part of Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s 23-year presidency, no foreign newspapers were allowed into Iraq. Satellite dishes were banned, and cable television was prohibitively expensive. The sole windows to the outside world were radio stations like the BBC, Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo, and the U.S. government's SAWA Radio.   Since the regime was overthrown in early April, a throng of freewheeling newspapers, radio and television stations have sprung up to replace the turgid, sycophantic media under Saddam. In the days immediately following the dictatorship's collapse, the country was left without any newspapers. State-run television and radio stations went off the air.   The vacuum was quickly filled by papers published by anti-Saddam groups in northern Iraq's Kurdish areas, such as al-Itihad (""Union"") and Nidaa al-Mustaqbal (""Call of the Future""), which made their way to Baghdad. The London-based Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat became the first foreign daily to be sold in the country on April 17.   Within days, new newspapers began appearing on the streets. Three independent radio stations and several local television stations went on the air.   ""It is still too early to speak about the freedom of the press,"" said Ali Abdel-Amir, senior editor of Nidaa al-Mustaqbal, a newspaper of the Iraqi National Accord, a longtime umbrella organization for Iraqi opposition groups.   ""There is anarchy now,"" Abdel-Amir said. ""Many of these people working in the press are not professional or objective.""   The U.S.-led military coalition that occupied the country has two radio networks of its own, one run by former employees of station previously owned by Saddam's elder son, Odai. Information Radio features news announcements, Arabic music and even Western music like the occasional rendition of ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News.   Another station, Radio of the Iraqi Republic, run by former Information Ministry officials, urges listeners to forget the past and work together for a better future.   In Baghdad, viewers can tune into the coalition information channel or watch channels from neighboring Iran, primarily the Arabic-language Al-Aalam.   Ali al-Fatlawi, a reporter who worked previously for government newspapers, says working for Assaah is much better.   ""There is more freedom and more openness,"" he said. ""The red lines have been lifted, and we can express ourselves freely and without threats.""

Rejecting criticism that the United States failed to prepare for the post-war occupation, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has suggested that no plan could have anticipated the conditions confronting US forces.   ""You couldn't know how it would end,"" Rumsfeld said in an interview with The New York Times published Sunday.

Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress and a great favorite of the Pentagon, warned his detractors that he had acquired about 60 tons of documents from the files of the Iraqi secret police and the Baath Party, and that the documents detailed Saddam Hussein's relations with other Arab leaders. He also threatened to shut down Al Jazeera and accused the television station's journalists of having been informants for the Iraqi government. ""We will not allow this channel to continue its destructive work, which might lead to civil war in Iraq through their lies and the spreading of rumors, because rumors,"" Chalabi said, ""are worse than killing."" President Bush continued to maintain that ""Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction"" even as high-ranking administration officials said that they would be ""amazed"" if such weapons were found. Other officials suggested that actual illegal weapons might not be found and said that they were more concerned with proving that there had been a ""capability"" to produce them. Weapons experts working in Iraq claimed that they had found a mobile bioweapons laboratory; other military officials in Iraq were skeptical of the claim, saying the evidence was inconclusive and that no trace of such weapons had been found. ""We came to bear country and we came loaded for bear,"" said one Defense Intelligence Agency official, ""and we found that the bear was not there."" Iraqi nuclear scientists warned that partially enriched uranium from the Al Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center had been taken by looters. ""I saw empty uranium-oxide barrels lying around,"" one scientist said. ""We saw people using them for milking cows and carrying drinking water."" People living near giant hog factories in the United States were complaining of neurological damage from hydrogen sulfide gas and other dangerous pollutants produced by vast manure cesspools. The Environmental Protection Agency was planning to give large industrial livestock farms amnesty for violations of the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, nominated an oilman from New Mexico to be secretary of the Navy. Two American soldiers were shot dead in Iraq, and people there continued to complain about the ongoing chaos and violence of the occupation. Doctors at Baghdad's Al Rashad state mental hospital said that American soldiers had knocked down their walls with tanks and then did nothing as the hospital was looted. The sole remaining patient, an insane killer named Ali Sabah, explained that he had stayed because ""I hate the world and the world hates me. I don't want the monkey to see me and I don't want to see the monkey.""   Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dropped his attempt to make permanent the broad surveillance powers granted the federal government by the Patriot Act, which are set to expire in 2005, and the Senate voted to expand the power of the government to spy on suspects who are not known to be associated with terrorist organizations. A German diplomat charged that the United States is turning into a police state. The National Archives announced that it was giving up its attempt to recover the famous 18-and-a-half-minute gap in President Richard Nixon's White House tapes. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy testified at his own bribery trial; he complained in an interview that he hadn't been to his house in Bermuda in three years, and said that he was the only man who could save Italy from Communism. ""How much longer,"" he asked, ""do I have to keep living this life of sacrifices?"" A one-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as he played outside his home in the Gaza Strip. Israel was cracking down on human-rights activists, and it began to require all foreigners entering the Gaza Strip, including United Nations relief workers, to sign a waiver stating that they will not hold the Israeli army responsible if it injures or kills them. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismissed the American peace ""roadmap"" as ""useless formulations that are not connected with reality."" A truck bomb killed at least 29 people at a government compound in Chechnya. A new study found that violent song lyrics produce violent thoughts and emotions in listeners.   King Mohammed of Morocco released 9,459 prisoners from jail to celebrate the birth of his son, Hassan, and reduced the sentences of 38,529 others. William J. Bennett gave up gambling; Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, said he didn't see what Bennett had done wrong and pointed out that gambling is ""not among the seven great sins or even among the 70 small ones."" The crew of the cargo ship Pesca Well was under investigation in Panama for possibly throwing five Dominican stowaways overboard. ""This case should be a lesson for all seafaring men,"" said a magistrate. ""Throwing people overboard is no way to solve a problem."" One hundred twenty-nine passengers were sucked out of a Congolese cargo plane when its rear door opened at 33,000 feet. President Bush appeared to be irritated at criticisms of his recent Top Gun moment: ""Listen,"" he said, ""it was an honor for me to go on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. I appreciate the chance to thank our troops. It was an unbelievably positive experience."" British scientists put six Sulawesi crested macaques in a room with a computer for a month and found that the monkeys, despite their affection for the letter S, failed to produce a single word but displayed a particular interest in defecating and urinating on the keyboard. It was reported that Microsoft is developing a portable toilet equipped with Internet access. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals announced a ""partial moratorium"" on its boycott of Kentucky Fried Chicken, a division of Yum Brands, after the company agreed to several demands, such as putting cameras in slaughterhouses to make sure the chickens are butchered as humanely as possible. A special federal and state task force was offering grief therapy to farmers in California whose chickens and other fowl were killed to stop the spread of Exotic Newcastle Disease. Federal authorities said that they will permit passengers to take cats, dogs, and other animals, including monkeys, on airplanes for emotional support but not snakes, rodents, or spiders. Swedish authorities refused to permit a couple to name their baby ""Staalman,"" which is Swedish for ""Superman."" The dollar was down against the euro. Scientists said they were very close to creating sperm.    urlLink http://www.harpers.org/weekly-review  Copyright 2003 Harper's Magazine Foundation

       Why are Women Leaving Corporate America and Where are They Going? by Denise Gürer   urlLink http://www.cobolreport.com/columnists/denise/07292002.asp   In todays fast paced world, people are expected to change jobs many times and even change careers several times in their lifetime.  Even so, women are leaving corporate America at twice the rate of men.  Why are they leaving and where are they going?  Many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender.  Many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling.  Many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate America is not willing to give.  Many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers.  For all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses.  A majority of these organizations are wildly successful.  Women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the U.S. overall economic health and competitiveness.    Why Are Women Leaving? Even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snails pace.  The glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back.  Thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions.  In fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (Moore and Buttner 1997).  In addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company.  In a different study by Catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (Catalyst 1998).  This suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments.  This further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their companys direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility.  In many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.  This cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity.    Another factor is many women feel they are undervalued.  In fact, pay equity is still a problem.  In the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (Chao 2001).  More specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (USDoL 2001).  Another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children.  However there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children.  This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers.  To counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both.  Many view this support as something the company should provide.  When the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors.  How Can Corporations Reverse This Trend? In todays knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections.  The loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements.  All of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (Donahue 1998).    A corporations first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular.  This could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews.  Statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem.  These could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria.  Gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion.  In particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company.    It is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them.  Based on this research, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented.  It is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort.  Managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity.    Some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting.   Women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (Van Velsor and Hughes 1990).  Thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization.  Another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued.  This is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male).  Other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation.    Essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business?  If business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women.  Given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women.  Characteristics and Culture of Women Owned Businesses Starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers.  However, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility.  They are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles.    For high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology.  Just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (NFWBO 2001b).  This follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the U.S.  The most recent statistics from the Department of Education show women graduates at 58.3% of B.S. graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (NCES 2001).   No matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table.  NFWBO found that 53% of women business owners emphasize right-brain thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (NFWBO 1994).  The same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events.    The attributes of a companys leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace.  Women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in family terms and work within a network of business relationships.  Men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (NFWBO 1994; Gürer 2001).  The NFWBO study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny.  Men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals.  Thus, womens leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a web of inclusion (see Gürer 2001; Helgesen 1995), while mens leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach.   Another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing.  Only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do.  For large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (NFWBO 1994).  In addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses.    Diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership.  Not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce.  Women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men).  Men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (NFWBO 2000a).    The Success of Women-Owned Businesses From an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful.  In 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (NFWBO 1999).  Of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue.  These businesses are also financially stable.  Women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all U.S. firms (CWBR 1995).  Businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy.  The growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (USCB 1997).  From 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%.  With respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (NFWBO 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector.    Still Some Difficulties Even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender.  One key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background.  These are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success.    Women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.  Only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.  In addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual angel investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (NFWBO 2000b).  Women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (NFWBO 2001b).  This reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity.    Given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.  There are currently programs that strive towards these goals  many of which can be linked to via the Center for Women's Business Researchs website at http://www.nfwbo.org  Catalyst for Change? The management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.  Interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.  A recent survey of technology professionals by Webgrrls, in western New York, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (Drury 2001).  Men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.  In addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.  It is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.  However, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.  The Webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.  Even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.  As the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.  The tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.  Regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.  These businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the Fortune 500 companies of the future.

      Alert: Total Lunar Eclipse Set Thursday  AP to My Yahoo!   LOS ANGELES - If the weather cooperates, a total lunar eclipse will be seen across North America late Thursday  the first visible in the United States in three years  and just before dawn Friday in western Europe and western and southern Africa.   A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth casts its shadow on the full moon, blocking the sunlight that otherwise reflects off the moon's surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye.   In North America, the moon will remain totally eclipsed for 53 minutes, and should turn substantially darker and reddish in color.   The total eclipse will start at 8:13 PDT in Los Angeles, 11:13 p.m. EDT in New York. A second lunar eclipse, on Nov. 8, will be visible from North and South America.   Eclipses once helped prove the Earth is round, because its shadow on the moon is curved.

      Shining true being: Meditation for the Dying  Imagine that your body no longer has the strength, the energy, to maintain its connection with the life-force, with the body of awareness within. And imagine now that you are beginning to experience the process of dissolving out of that body. Sensations from the body no longer so distinct, melting away, leaving just a spaciousness. Dissolving out of the body. Leaving that heavier form behind. Dissolving into consciousness itself.  My friend, listen now, for that which is called death has arrived. So let go gently, gently, of all that holds you back. Of all that pulls you away from this most precious moment. Know that now you have arrived at the transition called death. Open to it. Let go into it.   Recognise the changing experience of the mind as it separates from the body, dissolving.   Dissolving now into the realms of pure light. Your true nature shining everywhere before you.   My friend, maintain an open-heartedness, a spaciousness of being that does not grasp. Let things be as they are without the least attempt to interfere. Grasping at nothing.   Enter the essential nature of your own being shining there before you, a great luminosity. Rest in being. Knowing it for what it is. This light shining, luminous. Your true self.   Let go, gently, gently, without the least force. Before you shines your true being. It is without birth, without death.   Let go of all which distracts or confuses the mind, all that created density in life.   Go gently into it. Do not be frightened or bewildered. Do not pull back in fear from the immensity of your true being. Now is a moment for liberation.   Know that you are well guided by your compassion and love. You are the essence of all things. You are the light.   From 'Who Dies?' by Stephen Levine.

      For Each of You  Be who you are and will be learn to cherish that boistrous Black Angel that drives you up one day and down another protecting the place where your power rises running like hot blood from the same source as your pain.  When you are hungry learn to eat whatever sustains you until morning but do not be misled by details simply because you live them.  Do not let your head deny your hands any memory of what passes through them nor your eyes nor your heart everything can be useful except what is wasteful (you will need  to remember this when you are accused of destruction.) Even when they are dangerous examine the heart of those machines you hate before you discard them and never mourn the lack of their power lest you be condemned to relive them. If you do not learn to hate you will never be lonely  enough to love easily nor will you always be brave although it does not grow any easier  Do not pretend to convenient beliefs even when they are righteous you will never be able to defend your city while shouting.  Remember our sun is not the most noteworthy star only the nearest.  Respect whatever pain you bring back from your dreaming but do not look for new gods in the sea nor in any part of a rainbow Each time you love love as deeply as if it were  forever only nothing is  eternal.  Speak proudly to your children where ever you may find them tell them you are the offspring of slaves and your mother was a princess in darkness.  - Audre Lorde in From a Land Where Other People Live

       urlLink Researchers create flexible, paper-thin electronic screen  Associated Press  In a step toward electronic newspapers and wearable computer screens, scientists have created an ultra-thin screen that can be bent, twisted and even rolled up and still display crisp text.  The material, only as thick as three human hairs, displays black text on a whitish-gray background with a resolution similar to that of a typical laptop computer screen.  The screen is so flexible it can be rolled into a cylinder about a half-inch wide without losing its image quality.  Although it's not quite the dream of single-sheet, electronic newspapers or books that can display hundreds of pages of text, its creators said it's the first flexible computer screen of its kind.  ``I think it's a major step forward. We have cleared a big obstacle in electronic paper development,'' said Yu Chen, a research scientist with E Ink Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.  E Ink is one of several companies working to develop electronic ``paper'' for e-newspapers and e-books, and other possible applications -- even clothing with computer screens sewn into it.  The new screen is described in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.  Aris Silzars, the past president of the San Jose, Calif.-based Society for Information Display, said one of the technology's first applications could be something like an electronic tablet lawyers could use in place of bulky laptops.  But Silzars said the best uses of the new screen, which E Ink is still developing, may not be evident. ``It's very hard to predict where this thing may go,'' he said.  Chen and his co-workers made the 3-inch wide display screen flexible by developing a stainless steel foil topped with a thin layer of circuits that control an overlying film of electronic ink.  That ``ink,'' developed in 1997 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, contains tiny capsules with black and white particles with opposing electrical charges floating in a clear fluid.  When a negative voltage is run through circuits behind these capsules, the positive white particles move to the capsule's top. A positive current does the same to the negative black particles.  The human eye blends these resulting patterns of black- or white-topped capsules into text displayed in a traditional column.  Currently, information and power is fed to the screen through a wired hookup. But Chen's team is working on a self-contained system that could receive data through a wireless connection.  They also hope to boost the speed at which the screen switches to a new ``page'' of text, from the current quarter of a second to at least 10 times as fast, so it can display video.  Another goal is making the screen display a full range of colors.  Robert Wisnieff, senior manager of IBM Corp.'s Advanced Display Technology Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said E Ink's flexible screen is something many futurists believe is crucial to making electronic screens part of every day life.  He envisions such lightweight, thin screens being used for a credit card that could display the available balance or recent purchases.  Another possible use is a jacket with a screen sewn into its sleeve to allow its wearer to read e-mail while on the run, check stock prices or access maps in an unfamiliar city.  ``This is a peek at the future,'' Wisnieff said.

       urlLink Inner Voice  If you have found your truth within yourself there is nothing more in this whole existence to find. Truth is functioning through you. When you open your eyes, it is truth opening his eyes. When you close your eyes, it is truth who is closing its eyes.   This is a tremendous meditation. If you can simply understand the device, you don't have to do anything; whatever you are doing is being done by truth. You are walking, it is truth; you are sleeping, it is truth resting; you are speaking, it is truth speaking; you are silent, it is truth that is silent.   This is one of the most simple meditation techniques. Slowly, slowly everything settles by this simple formula, and then there is no need for the technique. When you are cured, you throw away the meditation, you throw away the medicine. Then you live as truth - alive, radiant, contented, blissful, a song unto yourself. Your whole life becomes a prayer without any words, or better to say a prayerfulness, a grace, a beauty which does not belong to our mundane world, a ray of light coming from the beyond into the darkness of our world.  Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 23  Commentary:  The Inner Voice speaks not in words but in the wordless language of the heart. It is like an oracle who only speaks the truth. If it had a face, it would be like the face at the center of this card - alert, watchful, and able to accept both the dark and the light, symbolized by the two hands holding the crystal. The crystal itself represents the clarity that comes from transcending all dualities.   The Inner Voice can also be playful, as it dives deep into the emotions and emerges again to soar towards the sky, like two dolphins dancing in the waters of life. It is connected with the cosmos, through the crescent-moon crown, and the earth, as represented by the green leaves on the figure's kimono.   There are times in our lives when too many voices seem to be pulling us this way and that. Our very confusion in such situations is a reminder to seek silence and centering within. Only then are we able to hear our truth.

A suicide bomber, who turned out to be a British citizen, responded to the confirmation of Mahmoud Abbas as prime minister by blowing up a nightclub in Tel Aviv, leaving body parts scattered along the shore. A day later Israeli tanks invaded a crowded neighborhood in Gaza and killed 12 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including two-year-old boy, in a hunt for a Hamas weapons smuggler. UNICEF reported that since the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada 92 Israeli and 436 Palestinian children have been killed. American soldiers shot and killed 15 Iraqi civilians who were demonstrating against the occupation on Saddam Hussein's birthday; a few days later another demonstration was held to protest the killings, and soldiers shot a few more. Anonymous Bush Administration officials were beginning to speak more candidly about the presidents rationale for invading Iraq, saying that Iraq's potential as a military threat was less important than its strategic location and the president's desire to make a ""global showoff American power and democracy."" Officials continued to play down the possibility that any significant weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq; one senior Whitehouse source speculated that what might turn up were some precursors,"" and said that Saddam Hussein ""couldn't put them together as long as the inspections were going on. President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier in an S-3BViking airplane and, clad in a military jumpsuit with the words ""Commander in Chief"" printed on the back, he informed the assembled sailors, whom he said were ""the best of our country,"" that the war on Iraq had been won. The commander in chief, who served as a pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War, told reporters that he had briefly flown the airplane. ""I miss flying,"" he said. Few publications mentioned the president's long unexplained failure to report for duty during that period, and his daring arrival was widely hailed as a ""Top Gun moment."" NBCofficials confirmed that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman will both appear on a future episode of ""Friends.""   William J. Bennett, the author of ""The Book of Virtues,"" ""The Death of Outrage,"" and ""The Moral Compass,"" among other books, was revealed to be a high-stakes gambler who has blown up to$8 million over the last decade playing high-limit slot machines and video poker. Bennett acknowledged that he has never condemned the vice of gambling. Somebody tried to shoot Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared that ""major combat"" was over in Afghanistan; Rumsfeld also made a victory tour of Iraq and was photographed autographing a Baghdad street sign that some soldiers had apparently taken as a souvenir. Researchers in England discovered that wood mice construct signposts out of leaves and twigs to keep themselves from getting lost. Consultants concluded that the Davis-Bessenuclear reactor in Ohio, which was shut down more than a year ago after it was discovered that acid had nearly eaten through its reactor vessel, still has problems with its safety culture."" Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, and several other firms agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement for fraudulently enticing millions of investors to buy billions of dollars' worth of stock they knew to be essentially worthless. Enron, MCI, and other companies that overstated their earnings in order to inflate the value of their stock were in the process of filing for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax refunds from the government on the profits they fraudulently claimed. Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, acknowledged that a number of his former aides are now actively lobbying him but denied that he would be swayed by personal connections. A few days later Ridge's department announced that it was establishing ethics rules. German archaeologists working in Iraq announced that they might have found the tomb of Gilgamesh.   The Bush Administration proposed giving the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon the power to issue administrative subpoenas"" for personal and financial information on American citizens without court approval. Attorney General John Ashcroft revealed that the Justice Department used secret warrants 1,228 times last year. The U.S. State Department complained in a report that Canadas contribution to the war on terrorism was being hampered by its obsession with civil liberties and personal privacy: Canadian laws and regulations intended to protect Canadian citizens and landed immigrants from government intrusion sometimes limit the depth of investigations."" The United States Commission on Civil Rights was ordered to pay an Hispanic employee $165,000 in damages for discriminating against her. President Bush issued a proclamation declaring May 1 ""Loyalty Day,"" and Prime Minister John Howard of Australia was rewarded for his country's service in the invasion of Iraq with a sleepover down at the Presidential Ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he was served green-chili cheese grits for supper. United Nations employees looted restaurants at the organization's headquarters in New York after food-service workers staged a wild-cat strike. ""It was chaos, wild, something out of a war scene,"" said one witness. ""They took everything, even the silverware."" India said it would reestablish diplomatic relations with Pakistan, Nepal opened negotiations with its rebels; the United States made a truce with an Iranian-backed guerrilla army in Iraq, and mercenaries in Ivory Coast murdered a rebel leader who told them to lay down their weapons. It was reported that Hilary Rosen, the CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America, has agreed to help rewrite Iraqs copyright laws. Pilgrims who bought tickets to seethe pope on his visit to Spain were given a McDonalds hamburger, medium fries, medium drink, and either an ice-cream sundae or an apple pie. Also included in the ticket price was a ""pilgrim's bag"" with a baseball cap, a rosary, and a copy of the Gospel According to St. Mark. A new study estimates that a shadow economy largely driven by marijuana, porn, and the labor of illegal aliens now constitutes up to10 percent of the American economy. Automobile pollution damages human sperm, Italian scientists found. Tissue engineers in Boston succeeded in growing penile tissue that contains nerve cells. ""This is exciting and extends their work logically in several directions,"" said a reconstructive surgeon. Kroger and Albertsons agreed to label farm-raised salmon so that consumers will be made aware of the fact that such salmon, which is naturally gray, has been dyed pink. Bostons city council decided to repeal a law mandating that all Indians in the city be jailed. Scientists discovered that fish can feel pain.

       urlLink Desiderata   Go placidly amid the noise and haste And remember what peace there may be in silence.  As far as possible without surrender,  Be on good terms with all persons.  Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others,  Even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons;  They are vexatious to the spirit.   If you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter,  For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.  Keep interested in your career, however humble;  It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.   Exercise caution in your business affairs,  For the world is full of trickery But let this not blind you to what virtue there is.  Many persons strive for high ideals  And everywhere life is full of heroism.   Be yourself.  Especially do not feign affection, Neither be cynical about love,  For in the face of all aridity and disappointment  It is as perennial as the grass.   Take kindly the counsel of the years,  Gracefully surrendering the things of youth.  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  But do not distress yourself with imaginings.  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.   Beyond a wholesome discipline be gentle with yourself.  You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars.  You have a right to be here. And whether it is clear to you or not,  No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.  Therefore be at peace with God,  Whatever you conceive him to be,  And whatever your labours and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life,  Keep peace with your soul.   With all its sham and drudgery and broken dreams  It is still a beautiful world.  Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.   Max Ehrman, 1927 Found in Old Saint Paul's Church, Baltimore, U.S.A.

      Harmony by Osho    Listen to your heart, move according to your heart, whatsoever the stake: A condition of complete simplicity costing not less than everything.... To be simple is arduous, because to be simple costs everything that you have. You have to lose all to be simple.That's why people have chosen to be complex and they have forgotten how to be simple. But only a simple heart throbs with God, hand in hand. Only a simple heart sings with God in deep harmony. To reach to that point you will have to find your heart, your own throb, your own beat.  Osho Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter 3  Commentary: The experience of resting in the heart in meditation is not something that can be grasped or forced. It comes naturally, as we grow more and more in tune with the rhythms of our own inner silences. The figure on this card reflects the sweetness and delicacy of this experience. The dolphins that emerge from the heart and make an arc towards the third eye reflect the playfulness and intelligence that comes when we are able to connect with the heart and move into the world from there. Let yourself be softer and more receptive now, because an inexpressible joy is waiting for you just around the corner. Nobody else can point it out to you, and when you find it you won't be able to find the words to express it to others. But it's there, deep within your heart, ripe and ready to be discovered.

       urlLink http://www.enneagramcentral.com/   Style Four : Fours are about authenticity. Fours have a deep and wide range of emotions and trust their subjective experience to make their life-decisions. They are frequently highly esthetic (not in talent, necessarily, but in concern), because they have a highly developed ability to think symbolically. This coupled with their emotional richness cries out for artistic expression.  Fours make a personal statement in many things they do, from the way they dress to their choice of Impressionist paintings. They rather enjoy not being part of the crowd and have a natural sense of aristocracy. Taste, they maintain, is not determined by votes. When they are less healthy, their speech becomes lamentation as they claim their uniqueness because of their suffering. They often develop a spirit of entitlement to compensate for a feeling that somehow they are defective. This defect, paradoxically, is the basis for their claim that they deserve love. They make a claim on their friends' love because they have suffered and this suffering has made them more authentic - and so more lovable.  Fours you may know: Shakespeare, Dennis Rodman, Nicholas Cage, Marlon Brando, Ann Rice, (Vampires are depicted as Fours), Kate Winslet, Vincent van Gogh, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, John Malkovich, Thomas Merton, and Allen Watts.   urlLink http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/journal.html  - More Personality Tests

       urlLink Who Am I? - (Nan Yar?)   As all living beings desire to be happy always, without misery, as in the case of everyone there is observed supreme love for one's self, and as happiness alone is the cause for love, in order to gain that happiness which is one's nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep where there is no mind, one should know one's self. For that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry of the form ""Who am I?"", is the principal means.    1 . Who am I ? The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, I am not.   2. If I am none of these, then who am I? After negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that Awareness which alone remains - that I am.   3. What is the nature of Awareness? The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss   4. When will the realization of the Self be gained? When the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which is the seer.   5. Will there not be realization of the Self even while the world is there (taken as real)? There will not be.   6. Why? The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.   7. When will the world which is the object seen be removed? When the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.   8. What is the nature of the mind? What is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the Self. It causes all thoughts to arise. Apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. Therefore, thought is the nature of mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).   9. What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind? That which rises as 'I' in this body is the mind. If one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'I' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. That is the place of the mind's origin. Even if one thinks constantly 'I' 'I', one will be led to that place. Of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'I' thought is the first. It is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.   10. How will the mind become quiescent? By the inquiry 'Who am I?'. The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization.   11. What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'Who am I?' When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'To whom do they arise?' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, ""To whom has this thought arisen?"". The answer that would emerge would be ""To me"". Thereupon if one inquires ""Who am I?"", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. When the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. Not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the Heart is what is called ""inwardness"" (antar-mukha). Letting the mind go out of the Heart is known as ""externalisation"" (bahir-mukha). Thus, when the mind stays in the Heart, the 'I' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the Self which ever exists will shine. Whatever one does, one should do without the egoity ""I"". If one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of Siva (God).   12. Are there no other means for making the mind quiescent? Other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. If through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for both mind and breath. Thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought ""I"" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent. But in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop. This is because of the will of God, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead. In the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled. Breath is the gross form of mind. Till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it. Therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa). Like the practice of breath-control. meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.   Through meditation on the forms of God and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed. The mind will always be wandering. Just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone. When the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind Self-inquiry will become easy. Of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to Self-inquiry.   13. The residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean. When will all of them get destroyed? As the meditation on the Self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed.   14. Is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure Self? Without yielding to the doubt ""Is it possible, or not?"", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the Self. Even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep ""O! I am a sinner, how can I be saved?""; one should completely renounce the thought ""I am a sinner""; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the Self; then, one would surely succeed. There are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one. It is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious. When the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil. The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people. However bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them. Both desire and hatred should be eschewed. All that one gives to others one gives to one's self. If this truth is understood who will not give to others? When one's self arises all arises; when one's self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent. To the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere.   15. How long should inquiry be practised? As long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry ""Who am I?"" is required. As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry. If one resorts to contemplation of the Self unintermittently, until the Self is gained, that alone would do. As long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.   16. What is the nature of the Self? What exists in truth is the Self alone. The world, the individual soul, and God are appearances in it. like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time. The Self is that where there is absolutely no ""I"" thought. That is called ""Silence"". The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is ""I""; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self.   17. Is not everything the work of God? Without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest. Just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of God that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas. God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him. That is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space.   18. Of the devotees, who is the greatest? He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most excellent devotee. Giving one's self up to God means remaining constantly in the Self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the Self. Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease?   19. What is non-attachment? As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment. Just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the Self-Pearl.   20. Is it not possible for God and the Guru to effect the release of a soul? God and the Guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the Guru's gracious look will be saved by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release. One can know oneself only with one's own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else's. Does he who is Rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is Rama?   21. Is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)? Just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the Self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the Self. The world should be considered like a dream.   22. Is there no difference between waking and dream? Waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference. Just as waking happenings seem real while awake. so do those in a dream while dreaming. In dream the mind takes on another body. In both waking and dream states thoughts. names and forms occur simultaneously.   23. Is it any use reading books for those who long for release? All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading. In order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one's Self is; how could this search be done in books? One should know one's Self with one's own eye of wisdom. The Self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. Since the Self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. There will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned.   24. What is happiness? Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not different. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. When the mind goes out, it experiences misery. In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self. Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-Happiness. Thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the Self and returning to it. Under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. A person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. Someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. A wise man stays permanently in the shade. Similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave Brahman. The mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to Brahman to experience happiness. In fact, what is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e. when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.   25. What is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)? Remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight.   26. What is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom? Desirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different; they are the same. Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object. Wisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the Self is wisdom.   27. What is the difference between inquiry and meditation? Inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self. Meditation consists in thinking that one's self is Brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss.   28. What is release? Inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage, and realising one's true nature is release.   SRI RAMANARPANAM ASTU

       urlLink BBC NEWS | South Asia | Sanskrit struggles to survive  Monday, 5 August, 2002, 12:51 GMT 13:51 UK  Students say Sanskrit offers no job prospects  By Sanjeev Srivastava  BBC correspondent in Bombay    One of the oldest languages in the world, Sanskrit, is in danger of becoming extinct in India, the country of its origin.   Although most Indian languages still use the basic grammar of Sanskrit, no more than a few thousand people in a country of more than one billion can claim to read, write and speak it fluently.   What was once the language of the elite in ancient India, Sanskrit no longer enjoys the exalted status it once had.   Poor job prospects   In Bombay's Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, one of the city's oldest and biggest education institutions. students recite Sanskrit shlokas.   We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit    Sanskrit scholar Girish Jani   Only 150 students come here to learn this ancient language - a very small number if you compare it with the tens of thousands of students who go out every day to the city's schools and colleges.   So why are so few students coming to learn Sanskrit?   The school's principal, Narendra Kumar Singh says there are very few jobs for anyone studying Sanskrit.    Some get jobs as priests   ""At most, they can become a teacher in Sanskrit schools, Sanskrit colleges so their salaries are also very meagre.""   ""The other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people,"" he added.   Lacking relevance?   The other reason why Sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses.   It was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry.   There are some who opt for Sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one's overall grades.   But most students learn the language to know about the past. Some study Sanskrit to improve their grades. There is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning Sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most Sanskrit colleges are publicly funded.   Critics of Sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses.   However, Sanskrit scholars like Girish Jani rubbish this approach.   ""Why should we read Shakespeare? Why should we read Sartre? Are they connected really with the life in the first attempt? No.   ""We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit.""   Scholars like Mr Jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about Sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement,   But the sad reality is that Sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin.

       urlLink NASA researcher, Rick Briggs has written:   ""In ancient India the intention to discover truth was so consuming, that in the process, they discovered perhaps the most perfect tool for fulfilling such a search that the world has ever known -- the Sanskrit language. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millennia old.  The discovery is of monumental significance. It is mind-boggling to consider that we have available to us a language which has been spoken for 4-7000 years that appears to be in every respect a perfect language designed for enlightened communication. But the most stunning aspect of the discovery is this: NASA the most advanced research center in the world for cutting edge technology has discovered that Sanskrit, the world's oldest spiritual language is the only unambiguous spoken language on the planet. Considering Sanskrit's status as a spiritual language, a further implication of this discovery is that the age old dichotomy between religion and science is an entirely unjustified one.  It is also relevant to note that in the last decade physicists have begun to comment on the striking similarities between their own discoveries and the discoveries made thousands of years ago in India which went on to form the basis of most Eastern religions.  Why has Sanskrit endured? Fundamentally it generates clarity and inspiration. And that clarity and inspiration is directly responsible for a brilliance of creative expression such as the world has rarely seen.   Another hope for the return of Sanskrit lies in computers. Sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit. The precision play of Sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that would inevitably transform the world. In fact the mere learning of Sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will provide in the arena of future communication.""

       urlLink Osho Zen Tarot  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharing    As you move above to the fourth center - that is the heart - your whole life becomes a sharing of love. The third center has created the abundance of love. By reaching to the third center in meditation, you have become so overflowing with love, with compassion, and you want to share. It happens at the fourth center, the heart.   That's why even in the ordinary world people think love comes out of the heart. For them it is just hearsay, they have heard it; they don't know it because they have never reached to their heart. But the meditator finally reaches to the heart. As he has reached to the center of his being - the third center - suddenly an explosion of love and compassion and joy and blissfulness and benediction has arisen in him with such a force that it hits his heart and opens the heart. The heart is just in the middle of all your seven centers - three centers below, three centers above. You have come exactly to the middle.  Commentary:  The Queen of Fire is so rich, so much a queen, that she can afford to give. It doesn't even occur to her to take inventories or to put something aside for later. She dispenses her treasures without limits, welcoming all and sundry to partake of the abundance, fertility and light that surrounds her.   When you draw this card, it suggests that you too are in a situation where you have an opportunity to share your love, your joy and your laughter. And in sharing, you find that you feel even more full.   There is no need to go anywhere or to make any special effort. You find that you can enjoy sensuality without possessiveness or attachment, can give birth to a child or to a new project with an equal sense of creativity fulfilled.   Everything around you seems to be ""coming together"" now. Enjoy it, ground yourself in it, and let the abundance in you and around you overflow.

       urlLink Osho Zen Tarot  - Courage   The seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed.   Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many.   There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves.   The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed.  Commentary:  This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun.   When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow.   The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them. Be courageous enough to grow into the flower you are meant to be.

       urlLink A glimpse into the heart of a dying star - Behind the scenes at a stellar chemical factory :  An image taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows one of the most unusually long planetary nebulae found so far. Scientists think planetary nebulae hold the key to understanding how the Universe became enriched with heavier elements so they study them intensively. It is not well-understood how a perfectly round star can turn into such an unusual-looking nebula.  {Apply this concept to people.}   Planetary nebulae occur in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They are the final stage of a star's life before it ends its days as a burnt-out white dwarf. When it dies, a star rapidly sheds the outer parts of its atmosphere, creating a planetary nebula that exists only as long as the star has fuel to burn.  {Apply this concept to people.}   Stars are large recycling factories. Over their lifetimes of millions of years they process huge amounts of the lighter elements (mostly hydrogen and helium)  {apply this concept to people}  into heavier ones (such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen)  {apply this concept to people} . These heavier elements are then dispersed into the surrounding space when the stars peel off their atmospheres to form planetary nebulae. In turn, the heavier elements may become part of other stars or end up in planetary systems like our own Solar System. This dispersion process is therefore one of the most important in the Universe and can tell us something about our own origins.  {Apply this concept to people.}

      Damn, this article is about my friend Bill and his cars.    urlLink South Seattle Star : Heap of the Week    Bill Jacobs' '69 Dodge van isn't pretty, but in some ways that makes it all the better for the uses he puts it to. On a recent sunny afternoon, the van held a load of llama manure bound for the vegetable beds at his Beacon Hill home, and a slant-6 engine Jacobs will install in another of his vehicles, a '63 Dart. And there was a Toyota engine in there, too. (Jacobs is partial to old Dodges and Toyotas. He also owns a banged-up Toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks. He replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.)   The van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier. And then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years. One previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member. And back when the van was new it was an animal control truck.  ""I don't think they called it that back then,"" Jacobs said. ""I think they called it the dog-catcher van. It was up in the San Juan Islands; I think that's why it has the rust.""  In the three or four years he has owned it, Jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission. ""It was so much work getting it out, I figured I would do it all,"" he said.  ""I'm not going to tell you how much money I've put into it,"" he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van.  ""I found the van on the Internet,"" Jacobs said. ""This guy wanted $400 for it. The picture looked so good, but when I got there it looked like (bleep!)."" So Jacobs bargained the price down.  ""I paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt,"" he said. ""They don't sell these anymore, so I had to have it rebuilt.""    Jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade (""I don't know if I'll keep doing this kind of work,"" he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is. And while he acknowledges that the van isn't in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it.   ""There's no way I could ever sell it and get back what I've put into it,"" he said.  That rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but Jacobs admits the van doesn't run as well as it could.  ""It would be nice to say that,"" he said. ""It doesn't run perfect, but it gets the job done.""

      This is a review written by Daniel. CD Hotlist is a great source for music reviews.   urlLink CD HOTLIST: NEW RELEASES FOR LIBRARIES  Artist: Annie Lennox  Title: BARE  Label: J Records  Cat. #: 8287652072-2  Genre: Pop/Rock  Release type: New  List price: $18.98  Comments: It has been 11 years since Annie Lennox's first solo album and four years since the short-lived Eurythmics reunion. She has returned with a set of self-penned songs that incisively explore the heartbreak and hope of love and relationships. Her voice sounds just as formidable as ever and is really something to behold on this disc. She provides all of the vocals, and hearing Annie Lennox back up Annie Lennox can be breathtaking. Framing the vocals are pop hooks, electric guitar, soul (of the Motown variety) and electronic soundscapes. This is an incredibly moving disc, best appreciated straight through, as the songs join to carry the listener on quite an emotional journey. (DB)

       urlLink I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes : ""Limits are necessary to give purpose and direction to life. Swimming in a sea of boundless opportunity would soon lead to exhaustion. Winging it alone in a sky of boundless opportunity would lead to being lost. In human affairs, the making of choices, and alliances, implies limitation, for in choosing one path another must be abandoned.  One key to a successful life is to select your limits consciously and carefully - to be discriminating in the setting of personal boundaries and knowing when to join in formation. Thrift, for example, often precedes prosperity; just as the letting go of selfish interests often leads to greater personal reward. Only by consciously accepting useful limits can one's energy be channeled to good purpose, and lead to lasting accomplishment.  Point yourself toward a middle way, the mean between discipline and freedom of spirit. Limits will come of their own accord; but to be able to consciously select your own affiliations in life - that's knowing how to fly! At the same time, do not go overboard on discipline. Even limitation must be limited, so that in attempting to bring order and direction into your life you do not choke off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity.  Similarly, in groups and organizations, the rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too soft. If too strict, they build frustration among people, and ultimately become destructive. If too lenient, sloppiness becomes acceptable, and energy is soon dissipated. The best path is one which allows for the fulfillment of individual potential, while encouraging self-discipline and focus.""

      Here's what the doctor says I have -  ACUTE BRONCHITIS  Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or bronchi (the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs). The inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust. When the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated beyond a certain point, the tiny hairs (cilia) within them, which normally trap and eliminate pollutants, stop functioning. Consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases. In response, a heavy secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 days. Severe cases may also cause general malaise and chest pain.

Situations are almost as if they were prepared in advance by some higher power. At any rate, it will be easy to see which path to take for your birthday year. You will be wanting to eliminate the things that confuse and delay your progress. Perhaps in scanning your working area you will be able to eliminate some of the unnecessary clutter, old files, etc. Clearing away the old and making way for the new is the attitude now. Your sense of responsibility will guide you in your affairs and duties today. Increased confidence may be the key that opens many a new door in your career. There are plenty of stimulating conversations for you to enjoy this afternoon. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Ashley thanks psychic Danielle for honesty in her reading.   Your Birthday Forecast - July 9 - Financial stability is the main focus this year as Saturn compels you to set up new disciplines and establish a more realistic plan of action for the future. Ending a connection or partnership that has become stagnant will open the door to healthier relationships. Take a risk that moves you outside your comfort zone to discover hidden talents and new ideas. New social connections arrive through classes or involvement in a creative activity. Discipline and structure are essential now; you need to move efficiently so you have enough time to nurture your sensitive Cancer nature. Increased energy will be yours if you commit to more physical exercise and healthier eating habits. A change of heart is inevitable in the last few months of 2003 as you realize that your thoughts are the only thing holding you back! Your lucky months are July and October. Your lucky numbers are 9, 17, 29, 31 and 32.   Your Horoscope for July 9, 2003 IF WEDNESDAY, JULY 9TH IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: The most important thing over the coming 12 months is that you focus your energies and your considerable talents in a single direction, which in turn means that you are going to have to decide, once and for all, where your true talents lie. It won't be easy - especially because you have so many competing interests - but if you don't specialize, you may never reach your full potential.   If today is your birthday, this is for you! You have a way with words this year, especially regarding love. Make sure you talk yourself into a lifestyle that you'll flourish within. No more fooling around. This year it's for keeps.  FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 9, 2003: Birthday Baby: You will take a very dedicated approach to life and you will not let down anyone who counts on you. You will be a strong contender and will never give in to failure or any form of weakness.

It is a waste of time and is of no use.  In the same way, if we have found a Guru, we should stop wandering and do sadhana, striving to reach the goal.   The Guru himself will come to the seeker.  There is no need to wander in search of him, but the seeker should have intense dispassion towards the world.   A Guru is indespensible for a sadhak (aspirant).  If a child goes near the edge of a pond, the mother points out the danger and leads the child away.  In like manner, the Guru gives appropriate instructions when necessary.  His attention is always on the disciple.   Even though God is all-pervading, a Guru's presence is unique.  Even though the wind blows everywhere, we enjoy coolness only under the shade of a tree.  Doesn't the breeze that blows through the leaves of a tree have a soothing effect on those who travel in the hot sun?  Similarly, a Guru is necessary for us who live in the scorching heat of worldly existence.  The Guru's presence will give us peace and tranquillity.   A real Guru desires only the spiritual growth of the disciple.  Tests and trials are given for the disciple's improvement and to remove his weaknesses.  A Guru may even blame a disciple for errors he has not committed.  Only those who steadily withstand such trials can grow.   Even though one may come in contact with a Guru, he will be accepted as a disciple only if he is fit.  Without Guru's grace, one cannot know the Guru.  One who is really in search of the Truth will have humility and simplicity.  The Guru's grace will be showered only on such a person.  A person full of ego cannot have access to the Guru.""  -- Mata Amritanandamayi, For My Children, San Ramon, CA: Mata Amritanandamayi Center, 1994

Everyone carries that masterpiece hidden for many lives, no knowing who they are and just trying on the surface to become someone.

       urlLink Free I-Ching Reading : ""Increase and decrease are part of the natural cycle of life. As another good book puts it, 'To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.' Like a reservoir that is being used to irrigate the fields, learning to accept a decrease in position or material possessions is part of preparing for increase in the future.  We may live in materialistic times, but there is no disgrace in material decrease, particularly if it represents an investment in future gain - even if that gain be in the form of learning or the development of personal character. Likewise, the inner strength that comes from bearing loss can be balanced by a corresponding increase in inner strength and insight. When letting go of material desires leads to a greater simplicity in daily life, good fortune often comes calling.  In nature, the lake evaporates to form the clouds that drop the rain which nurtures the surrounding forest. As the forest grows thick, more rain is captured for the lake. Similarly, an 'evaporation' or decrease in one area of your life, may give rise to an eventual increase. A loss of responsibility at work can mean more free time; more free time may generate more career options. A decrease in material possessions can free the spirit and fill the soul.  Be mindful of the lesson of young lovers: even with a minimum of possessions, feelings of the heart can bring an unsurpassed richness to life. The smallest of actions, if sincere, have value. So remain confident, for a time of decrease may actually bode good fortune. Especially if you remain open to that possibility.  Let go of frustration, resistance and regret over whatever may be decreasing at this time. Accept the cycle.""

       Realization: The Poori Effect: How We Sometimes Fool Ourselves  Just seated in an Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant with a friend, a beaming waitress comes along, ""Poori or nan (traditional flour-based foods)?"" I replied ""Two nans please."" She remarked enthusiastically, ""Oh, would you like to try the poori?"" ""No."" She smiled on, ""They are very nice. Have you tried them before? You should try!"" I smiled weakly, ""Okay one poori and one nan."" I tried poori before, but prefer nan. But she was so unknowingly pushy that I patronised her. She walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, ""Was the poori nice?"" My friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod. She too prefers nan. The waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another ""happy"" customer.   I call this ""The Poori Effect."" It is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one's perceptions. The waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite. Due to the way she carried herself, we ""naturally obliged"". We were later ""obliged"" to give her a positive response- out of ""courtesy"". The result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori. We might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion. We sometimes ""unwittingly"" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back. But is your smile true? On the other hand, is your smiling ""forcing"" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely? We see what we want to see. I know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs. The Poori Effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith. We are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback. This is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within. When we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too. Either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue. Can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way? Even if the truth bites a little, does it matter? Since it is ""sugar-coated"" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right?    Asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind. Some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like. ""No no, what does he know? Pooris are the best!"" Do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you? But what is the truth about preferences and opinions? Preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the Buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory. Because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject. Everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less. Pooris might taste much better if I let go of my aversion? Nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers?   Let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes. The more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others. When we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively. This is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment. Only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to Enlightenment! -  urlLink shian@TheDailyEnlightenment.com

       urlLink Rakhi Day Meaning from the India Heritage Research Foundation  ""The holiday of Rakhsha Bandhan, or Rakhi, is a celebration of the bond of love and the bond of family. On this day, sisters tie sacred threads around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and affection. In return, the brother promises to protect his sister and to always be there for her. Rakhsha means protection or security and bandhan means a bond or relation. Thus, Rakhsha Bandhan symbolizes the bond of security and protection between brothers and sisters. However, on Rakhi, the brothers and sisters do not have to be blood relatives. That is the beauty of Indian culture. Our tradition tells us that the world is our brother and sister. As the dawn breaks on the new millennium, we must realize that the only way the world will survive is united as one family. Thus, now, we must also take the deeper, underlying meaning of Rakhi. We must vow to make the world our brothers and sisters not only in theory, but also in practice. Let us use rakhi as a symbol of our universal brotherhood. May our girls and women lead the way toward this universal family as they tie rakhi bracelets on the wrists of not only their closest male friends, but also on the wrists of enemies. Let us use this holiday to reach out to those around us, embracing them as brother and sister.""

       urlLink Osho Zen Tarot Card: Laziness  ""When you are lazy, it is a negative taste: you simply feel that you have no energy, you simply feel dull; you simply feel sleepy, you simply feel dead. When you are in a state of non-doing then you are full of energy--it is a very positive taste. You have full energy, overflowing. You are radiant, bubbling, vibrating, You are not sleepy, you are perfectly aware. You are not dead--you are tremendously alive....There is a possibility the mind can deceive you: it can rationalize laziness as non-doing. It can say, 'I have become a Zen master,' or, 'I believe in Tao'--but you are not deceiving anybody else. You will be deceiving only yourself. So be alert.  Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 8  Commentary: This gentleman clearly thinks he's got it made. He sits in his big over-stuffed chair, wearing his sunglasses, shaded by his umbrella, with his pink slippers and his piña colada in his hand. He doesn't have the energy to get up and do anything because he thinks he's done it already. He hasn't yet turned to see the mirror cracking around him on his right, a sure sign that the place he thinks he's finally arrived at is about to shatter and dissolve before his very eyes. The message this card brings is that this poolside resort is not your final destination. The journey isn't over yet, as that white bird flying into the vastness of the sky is trying to show. Your complacency might have arisen from a real sense of achievement, but now it's time to move on. No matter how fuzzy the slippers, how tasty the piña colada, there are skies upon skies still waiting to be explored.""

The name Holotropic means literally 'moving toward wholeness' (from the Greek 'holos'=whole and 'trepein'=moving in the direction of something).  The process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated breathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With the eyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. This state activates the natural inner healing process of the individual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process, the quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for that particular time and place. While recurring themes are common, no two sessions are ever alike.  Additional elements of the process include focused energy release work and mandala drawing. Holotropic Breathwork is usually done in groups, although individual sessions are also possible. Within the groups, people work in pairs and alternate in the roles of experiencer and 'sitter'. The sitter's role is simply to be available to assist the breather, not to interfere or interrupt the process. The same is true for trained facilitators, who are available as helpers if necessary.""

       Today's Cancer Horoscope   by Astrocenter.com : Today, dear Cancer, is a day to separate the wheat from the chaff. Or, in other words, to take a good long look at your relationships and decide who is a true friend and who is not. You are very loyal, which is certainly to your credit. But what is the point of being loyal to people who do not return the courtesy? You have given your so-called friends more than enough opportunities to demonstrate their affection. As difficult as it may be for you, it is time to let these relationships fall by the wayside. Look at it this way: this will free you up to spend more time with your true friends.   by Tarot.com : The primary issue in your life comes back to a recurring theme. What do you feel in your gut? And how does this differ from what you need to do in order to maintain your own stability? Its a variation on the head versus heart stuff. The feelings are clearly telling you one thing, but logic pushes you in a slightly different direction.

       urlLink The Transformation Tarot : ""A king went into his garden and found wilted and dying trees, shrubs and flowers. The oak said it was dying because it could not be tall like the pine. Turning to the pine, he found it drooping because it was unable to bear grapes like the vine. And the vine was dying because it could not blossom like the rose. He found Heart's-ease blooming and as fresh as ever. Upon inquiry, he received this reply:   'I took it for granted that when you planted me you wanted Heart's-ease. If you had desired an oak, a vine or a rose, you would have planted them. So I thought that since you put me here, I should do the best I can to be what you want. I can be nothing but what I am, and I am trying to be that to the best of my ability.'   You are here because this existence needs you as you are. Otherwise somebody else would have been here!--existence would not have helped you to be here, would not have created you. You are fulfilling something very essential, something very fundamental, as you are. If God wanted a Buddha he could have produced as many Buddhas as he wanted. He produced only one Buddha--that was enough, and he was satisfied to his heart's desire, utterly satisfied. Since then he has not produced another Buddha or another Christ.   He has created you instead. Just think of the respect that the universe has given to you! You have been chosen, not Buddha, not Christ, not Krishna. You will be needed more, that's why. You fit more now. Their work is done, they contributed their fragrance to existence. Now you have to contribute your fragrance.   But the moralists, the puritans, the priests, they go on teaching you, they go on driving you crazy. They say to the rose, 'Become a lotus.' And they say to the lotus, 'What are you doing here? You have to become something else."" They drive the whole garden crazy, everything starts dying--because nobody can be anybody else, that is not possible.   That's what has happened to humanity. Everybody is pretending. Authenticity is lost, truth is lost, everybody is trying to show that he is somebody else. Just look at yourself: you are pretending to be somebody else. And you can be only yourself--there is no other way, there has never been, there is no possibility that you can be anybody else. You will remain yourself. You can enjoy it and bloom, or you can wither away if you condemn it.""

        urlLink Weekly Review - Sep 9, 2003: Harper's Magazine   President George W. Bush made a televised address to the nation and declared that Iraq was now the ""central front"" in the war on terrorism. He called for national resolve and national sacrifice and said that he will ask Congress for $87 billion in emergency funds for the occupation. It was noted that this new request, which comes on top of $79 billion already approved, will probably push the current budget deficit up to $600 billion. Howard Dean said the speech, which made no mention of Osama bin Laden, was ""outrageous"" and said it reminded him of Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. Senator Bob Graham observed that Bush now wants to spend more on Iraq this year than the federal government will spend on education. Gunmen fired on a Sunni mosque in Baghdad just after morning prayers and injured three people, a car bomb exploded near the headquarters of the Baghdad police department, a British bomb squad expert was killed, an American Humvee was blown up, and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez said that attacks on American forces were down to about 14 or 15 a day. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was touring Iraq and Afghanistan, complained that the news media was ignoring ""the story of success and accomplishment"" in Iraq. Rumsfeld acknowledged that he still doesn't know who is carrying out the guerrilla attacks but said that the intelligence community is working on it. ""They're not comfortable at the moment with what we don't know."" A man died and several others were injured while riding Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The World Council of Churches denounced the invasion of Iraq as ""immoral"" and ""ill advised"" and called for the withdrawal of American forces. A congressional study found that the occupation of Iraq is unsustainable given the current size of the U.S. military, and the United States released a draft resolution calling on the United Nations to create a multinational peacekeeping force for Iraq that would remain under American military and political control. Heavy fighting continued in Afghanistan, and surface-to-air missiles were fired at a transport plane in Baghdad. Donald Rumsfeld, who was nearby, said that such attacks are just a cost of doing business. Rumsfeld claimed that there has been ""breathtaking"" progress in Afghanistan since the war ended. ""I'm not being Pollyannaish,"" he said. ""I'm telling the truth.""   President Bush, apparently worried about the fact that the American economy has lost almost 3 million jobs since he took office, promised to appoint a ""manufacturing czar"" who will watch out for blue-collar jobs. The Labor Department announced that 93,000 jobs were lost in August, and a new study found that the federal workforce is at its highest level (12.1 million) since the Cold War. The Census Department reported that the number of poor people increased last year by 1.3 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a settlement with energy companies that benefited from market manipulation in the California energy crisis two years ago. The companies agreed to pay about $1 million in fines, or about 3 cents for every Californian, though the energy scam cost the state $8.9 billion, or $250 per citizen. The Environmental Protection Agency relaxed restrictions on selling land contaminated with PCBs, and an astronomer argued that Venus once had a climate similar to Earth's, prior to its transformation by the greenhouse effect. A federal appeals court blocked the FCC's new rules expanding the freedom of media monopolies, and Jessica Lynch, the former Army private who was captured by Iraqis and became the subject of an elaborate heroic fiction, signed a book deal and reportedly received a $1 million advance. Lynch will share the advance with her co-author Rick Bragg, a former New York Times reporter. Seattle was considering a tax on espresso.   North Koreans danced in the streets holding bunches of flowers to celebrate the reelection of Kim Jong Il as chairman of the National Defense Commission, his primary office; Kim Il Sung, who has been dead for almost ten years, is still officially the head of state. The Bush Administration retreated from its position that North Korea must simply submit to American demands; one State Department source said that the policy shift was accomplished while many of the Pentagon officials who have driven the administration's hard-line stance were on vacation. There were rumors of a coup plot in the Philippines. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt condemned gay marriage. An Israeli commission of inquiry concluded that police used excessive force in putting down a riot by Israeli Arabs three years ago in which 13 people were killed. The commission suggested that the police stop using snipers armed with rubber-coated steel bullets to disperse Arab crowds. Three Israeli F-15 fighter jets piloted by the descendants of Holocaust survivors flew over the Auschwitz death camp in Poland during a memorial service. The Auschwitz Museum had opposed the flyover, saying that a military display was inappropriate on such an occasion. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian prime minister, resigned, and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, was injured in an Israeli airstrike. A car bomb blew up in a market outside Srinagar, Kashmir, killing at least six people and wounding dozens. A train was blown up in Chechnya. Twin sisters in Morocco were arrested for plotting a suicide attack. Charles Bronson died. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy said that judges are lunatics and are anthropologically different from other people. Paul J. Hill, a Christian who murdered an abortion doctor in Pensacola, Florida, was executed by lethal injection. Hill said that he was looking forward to getting his reward in heaven. Christians holding signs wept outside the prison; one sign read ""Dead Doctors Can't Kill."" Interrogators at Camp Delta, the American penal colony in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were said to be using Twinkies and McDonald's Happy Meals to make the prisoners talk. Britney Spears, a pop star, declared her faith in President Bush: ""Honestly,"" she said, ""I think we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes and we should just support that.""

How would it affect your state if, each time you came through on a promise or duty or performed some beneficial action, you took the time to acknowledge yourself? What if you take a moment and thank yourself?   Become sensitive to the good things that you do, especially something out of the blue.

This can create either a feeling of panic or relief. On the other hand, having no blueprint frees you up from the pressure of expectations.

Evil need not take extravagant, forms, such as those exhibited in Nazi Germany. Garden-variety lies and deceit are much more common and persistent, but should be rooted out just as diligently. One must be resolved against negativity - whether in one's social or professional life, or in one's own soul. In either case, definite rules must be followed for the struggle to succeed.  The first rule: do not compromise with evil. Negative actions must be identified openly for what they are, and discredited. The second: one cannot resist negativity on its own terms. New, positive alternatives which lead away from the source of the problem are generally more successful, and appropriate, than to counter negativity with raw power. The third rule: the means used to counter negativity must be consistent with the end to be achieved. One cannot stop the spreading of lies by spreading more of them.  Spring is approaching. Good times ahead seems inevitable; there is vitality in the air. This is a most auspicious time. Like a snake emerging from hibernation, negative forces are only just beginning to stir, and can be effectively controlled. This is a time of hopeful progress, and must be used to best advantage. When approaching good fortune, conscientious work pays great dividends. A clear road lies ahead.  Act now, for at some point this ripe opportunity for advancement will be reversed. No spring lasts forever. It's always wise to stay alert and note the changing signs of the times.  Spring is always the season of new relationships. In the bounty of good times, new bonds are formed effortlessly. Relationships born in spring can serve well to warm the following autumn and winter.""

      ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups ---------------------~--> Bodhi Mail  - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bodhimail -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Message: 1    Date: Tue, 07 Oct 2003 14:48:42 -0500    From: ""SD""   Subject: we donot pray to Buddha to save us  Develop wisdom to overcome Avijjaa  By P. S. Mahawatte   Almost all religions in the world except Buddhism have as their foundation a creator God and an immortal soul. Let us briefly examine the core beliefs of a few of these religions.  The core belief in Hinduism is, after death one joins Paramathma. They are required to have utmost Faith in the Trio- Brahma - (Creator); Vishnu - (Ruler) and Shiva- (Destroyer) of the Universe. To them, Moksya could be achieved only after death. There are other gods such as Ganapathy and Skanda and by having faith in them, they can pray to enable them to find security and lead prosperous lives.  Buddhists, too, visit these Kovils and pray to these Gods seeking mundane help to overcome their various day to day problems. But unlike Hindus, the Buddhists perform meritorious acts and transfer the merit thus acquired, to Gods and seek their help. According to Buddhism Gods are unable to commit meritorious acts by themselves. The Buddha said that people pray out of fear and that fear is due to inability to understand things as they really are. This is due to Avijja - nescience or ignorance and the Buddha has taught his disciples how to develop the Wisdom needed to bring to an end this Avijja.  Almighty God  Christianity which came to be long after Hinduism also believes in an Almighty God as the creator of the universe. They are expected to have complete faith in the Trinity - Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. This appears to have some similarity to the Hindu trio Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Their Mokshya which they believe as joining their soul with the Creator, can be achieved only after death and that too, only with Gods love and repenting for their sins and prayer. They cannot achieve Mokshya by their own efforts.  Islam also requires absolute faith in Almighty Allah and is also based on Atma - Soul and to have utmost faith in the Creator God and to pray daily, so that after death they join their Creator - Mokshya.  The followers of the above religions hold fast to the belief that there is an immortal soul somewhere within them, which they want to continue to exist forever, by joining with their Creator.  Let us now listen to what the Buddha had to say on this subject. A Bhikku once asked the Buddha Ven. Sir, is there a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found.  The Buddha said Yes, Bhikku there is. A man has the following view. The Universe is that Atman, I shall be that after death, permanent, abiding, everlasting, unchanging and I shall exist as such for eternity.  He hears the Thathagatha or a disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the complete destruction of all speculative views ... aiming at the extinction of Thirst Thanha, aiming at detachment, cessation Nirvana. Then that man thinks I will be annihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be no more. So he mourns, worries himself, laments, weeps, beating his breasts and become bewildered. Thus O Bhikku, there is a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found (from What the Buddha taught by late Dr. Walpola Rahula thera).

       urlLink Metagifted Education Resource Organization: Introduction to Indigo Children :  What's an Indigo Child?  by Wendy H. Chapman  Indigo Children are the current generation being born today and most of those who are 8 years old or younger. They are different. They have very unique characteristics that set them apart from previous generations of children. The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability. These are the children who are often rebellious to authority, nonconformist, extremely emotionally and sometimes physically sensitive or fragile, highly talented or academically gifted and often metaphysically gifted as well, usually intuitive, very often labeled ADD, either very empathic and compassionate OR very cold and callous, and are wise beyond their years. Does this sound like yourself or your child?   Indigos have come into this world with difficult challenges to overcome. Their extreme levels of sensitivity are hard to understand and appreciate by parents who don't share this trait. Their giftedness is unusual in such high numbers. Their nonconformity to systems and to discipline will make it difficult to get through their childhood years and perhaps even their adult years. It is also what will help them accomplish big goals such as changing the educational system, for instance. Being an Indigo won't be easy for any of them, but it foretells a mission. The Indigo Children are the ones who have come to raise the vibration of our planet! These are the primary ones who will bring us the enlightenment to ascend.   There's a very good chance your child is an Indigo if he/she was born after 1992. About 85% or higher of children born in '92 or later, 90% born in '94 or after and 95% or more born now (some even say 99%) are Indigo Children! Does this mean you aren't one if you were born prior to 1992? No! I've heard reports that they started coming in the 80s, but that means coming in larger numbers. I believe there have been Indigos born in every year, but perhaps not in high enough percentages to notice their presence and see what makes them so unique. So can you be a 24 yr old Indigo or a 50 year old one? Yes!    urlLink NEXT - Is Your Child an Indigo?

In Scorpio we went through the dark tunnel of initiation. Now in Sagittarius we emerge into the bright sunlight, spread our wings, and fly. We feel reborn, and the world is our oyster. We want to announce it to one and all.  Sun and Moon's last contacts were their squares with Uranus, and they come into this fresh world with a great deal of independence. This eclipse will renew our autonomy, both personally and in the world. Uranus can also indicate surprises, and in Washington DC it is exactly overhead.  Mars is still jazzed up from its opposition to adventurous Jupiter, and it's now building up to a very assertive square with Pluto on Wednesday. At the same time, during the 48 hours from last night through tomorrow night, both Mercury and Moon square Mars and conjoin Pluto to fill our hearts and minds with aggressive vibes.  This is a dangerous time. A solar eclipse hides consciousness and allows the unconscious to rule. Sagittarius is the sign of the gambler. And aggressive Mars/Pluto impulses are raining into our head and heart, represented by Mercury and Moon.  Moon not only transits over Mercury tomorrow night; but it also eclipses Mercury, thus blotting out logic, and giving Mercury extra significance. Mercury adds to the already-strong movement and travel urges of this time.  Sagittarius is expansive. It is a no-holds-barred sign, always ready to go. It is very helpful now to have a plan of action, as a channel for the energy which is being released.

       urlLink FTAA lite seen as deal-breaker  By STEVEN CHASE Miami  Canada and other countries warned yesterday that a bid by the United States and Brazil to significantly narrow the scope of a proposed free-trade area of the Americas agreement could derail the talks under way in Miami. A group opposed to the barebones deal  including Canada, Chile, and Mexico  says the 'FTAA lite' salvage proposal Washington and Brasilia have cobbled together to salvage talks is insufficient to keep negotiations moving forward.  'This is simply a papering over of differences and is not enough to establish a basis for continuing [talks],' a source close to FTAA negotiations in Miami said yesterday. The move by Washington and Brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator FTAA deal, ridiculed as 'FTAA lite', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the Western Hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers.  It would fall grievously short of the sweeping and comprehensive 'NAFTA on steroids' goal envisaged in 1994, when preparatory FTAA negotiations first began among all countries in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba. Trade watchers are increasingly suspicious that the United States' only aim in Miami is to keep talks alive until the meeting ends Nov. 21.

When someone quotes the old poetic image about clouds gradually uncovering the moon, slowly loosen knot by knot the strings of your robe.  Like this.  If anyone wonders how Jesus raised the dead, dont try to explain the miracle. Kiss me on the lips.  Like this. Like this.  When someone asks what it means to 'die for love,' point here.  If someone asks how tall I am, frown and measure with your fingers the space between the creases on your forehead.  This tall.  The soul sometimes leaves the body, then returns. When someone doesnt believe that, walk back into my house.  Like this.  When lovers moan, theyre telling our story.  Like this.  I am a sky where spirits live. Stare into this deepening blue, while the breeze says a secret.  Like this.  When someone asks what there is to do, light the candle in his hand.  Like this.  How did Josephs scent come to Jacob?

To start, we'll be building soundproof recording booths across the country, called StoryBooths. Our first one opens in Grand Central Terminal in New York City on October 23, 2003. You can use these StoryBooths to record broadcast-quality interviews with the help of a trained facilitator.  We've tried to make the experience as simple as possible. We'll help you figure out what questions to ask. We'll handle all the technical aspects of the recording. At the end of the hour-long session, you'll get a copy of your interview on CD. And thanks to the generous contributions of our supporters, all this costs only $10.  Since we want to make sure your story lives on for generations to come, we'll also add your interview to the StoryCorps Archive, housed at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, which we hope will become nothing less than an oral history of America.

Within this pattern is yet another powerful pattern known as The Star of David, an important mystic symbol.  This is the most significant alignment in the 6,000 year span between 3,000 BC and 3,000 CE. This is one powerful moment in time -- but its effects can last for centuries to come.   The general consensus is that (at the very least) this moment is likely to bestow grace and blessings upon those who spend this time and use the high energies it produces with their hearts and minds focused spiritually.  There have been numerous speculations about what might happen during this time. Some are rather extreme, to say the least. Some expect to see the first wave of Ascension take place. Others are waiting for spaceships to take us away. Still others wonder if the astrological chart is foretelling a type of universal rapture.   Blaze believes it is not so much about the outward events, but an opportunity for to make this time as spiritually powerful as possible. In other words, be spiritually proactive; dont wait for things to happen.  Powerful planetary events can and often do coincide with events in the world around us, and these can indeed be regarded as signposts from the Cosmos. Astrology is a language of the Divine, and It uses such events to talk to us.   However, first we have to raise our vibrations through spiritual work and meditation, in order to attune ourselves to what is being said. Once we learn to do this, then indeed we can expect sublime events,""

First, the eclipse itself is one of the best of the Saros series of eclipses. An eclipse series has a history behind it, bringing forth either positive or negative energy. This one is positive. All the best of Taurus energy is flowing in and around this eclipse. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and harmony. Taurus is concerned with the issues of relationships, money, real estate, beauty and the greenery of the earth. Taurus is the gardener of the zodiac, the one who plants her garden and then waits and watches it grow. Now is a great time to plant some seeds and wait for them to shoot up.""

Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting that joyful way of being in the elder years.  Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to contemplative practice, service and ecology. Our educational program includes symposia, focus groups and study groups. As an extension of these educational efforts, a community based on the principles developed in the symposia is being planned. The community will be open to anyone with a contemplative spiritual practice. The community's physical structure will be organized according to the principles of Permaculture. Permaculture allows that in natural systems, there is no waste; all resources can create benefit.   At Jubilados, old age is seen not as an end point, but rather as a rededication to creative service as an expression of the spiritual connection. The community is in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The site provides a setting conducive to spiritual practice, and is close to medical, educational and recreational services. More important, the proximity affords the opportunity for meaningful service in many community settings. The Jubilados Community will create an integrated lifestyle, based on mutual support rather than dependence.  The physical plant will be constructed in traditional village design with clustered buildings, allowing for the greater part of the site to be dedicated to open space. Common areas will include a meditation hall, communal kitchen, dining facilities and administrative offices. There will also be a library, a theatre, a gym and studios. Residences will consist of eight bedroom / bathroom suites clustered around a common kitchen / living area. Jubilados will begin construction in a year and will be ready to receive occupants in 2002.

And if in this reality, with the divine power of life we have been given which is not defined, the destiny of our life is marked by its transience."" ~ Don Isidro, Wise elder of the Kekchi Maya  ""When a wise one speaks, it is not to convince the incredulous. They do it to guide and awaken the consciousness of those that follow the path towards consciousness. Their words are not only for intellectual debate or for the nourishment of the spirit. In actuality, the spirituality of these prophetic times are not limited to contemplation and meditation. Today spirituality is synonymous with action; and action is every act of your life, in harmony with Mother Nature, and most importantly the harmony within ourselves, and in relation to the way in which we live."" ~ Don Pascual, Wise elder of the Mam Maya ""

       Your Week in Focus by John - December 08 to 14  There is no doubt that you are more serious about your objectives than you have been for some time, HEATHER. Yet, on the other hand, you are also a lot more fearful of failing. It seems that you have the choice to have more faith in yourself and to stretch yourself to try new things, or you can instead choose to ignore the opportunities banging on your door, and carry on in the same old way. Yet the influences around you at this time will encourage you to explore new options. Venus and Mercury in your opposite sign of Capricorn may mean that friends, loved ones, and anyone you are with on a regular basis will all try to encourage you to do things that they know will make you feel a whole lot better. You need a touch of ecstasy after all that you have been through. And your friends want to see you sing and dance, love and be filled with joy. Much of what you will be combating at this time will be the devils within, rather than the circumstances without. The Sun conjuncts Pluto in Sagittarius, which means that a change of rules or a new project may bring a delightful new element into your working week.

      The contemplation for this week is: ""The Sanskrit word for trust is visvas, which means breathe easy. When you find yourself complaining, My tolerance is growing thin, take a moment and be with yourself. Feel your nervous system, breathe easy, and delight in the fullness of the heart. Breathe easy. Visvas. Visvas means breathe easy. Breathe easy, freely, and naturally. Allow yourself to be tolerant in trust. Breathing easy gives patience. Breathing easy gives you access to your core strength. Breathing easy produces stability."" -- Gurumayi Chidvilasananda

       urlLink My Tarot Reading For Today : Your situation is changing. Your future seems uncertain. Take heart and wait it out -- peace will return in its own time. In the meanwhile, do not waste your precious life force worrying about something you cannot control. The Situation position refers to the general set of influences that surround you and affect your personal experience of peace. We all have to deal with conflict and are affected by the process.  When the Wheel of Fortune is in this position, your circumstances may be constantly fluctuating. The changes are driven by a force no mortal can control. Your immediate future is so uncertain. No one can blame you for feeling a bit overwhelmed or confused. Still, you need not succumb to despair. The force in operation is the great washing machine of life. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, then the end result will leave you restored, like new.  As with the wheel, what appears up will soon be down and vice versa. In the end, everything will be resolved. It is still a challenge to keep your composure in mid-cycle, however, because the part of you that prefers control feels helpless. Wait and watch from a quiet, meditative place inside yourself, and as you do so, try to absorb and understand the process. You'll be fine if you go with the flow.

       The Winter of Listening   No one but me by the fire, my hands burning red in the palms while the night wind carries everything away outside.  All this petty worry while the great cloak of the sky grows dark and intense round every living thing.  What is precious inside us does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence.  What we strive for in perfection is not what turns us into the lit angel we desire,  what disturbs and then nourishes has everything we need.  What we hate in ourselves is what we cannot know in ourselves but what is true to the pattern does not need to be explained.  Inside everyone is a great shout of joy waiting to be born.  Even with the summer so far off I feel it grown in me now and ready to arrive in the world.  All those years listening to those who had nothing to say.  All those years forgetting how everything has its own voice to make itself heard.  All those years forgetting how easily you can belong to everything simply by listening.  And the slow difficulty of remembering how everything is born from an opposite and miraculous otherness. Silence and winter has led me to that otherness.  So let this winter of listening be enough for the new life I must call my own.   ~  David Whyte

They can generate a variety of job possibilities, consider them for their ability to fulfill their values, and pursue them using their skills in communicating with others, either in writing or in person. Their idealism, commitment, flexibility and people skills will usually be communicated to others in the job search. Potential drawbacks for INFPs in the job search include unrealistic expectations for a job, feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence, and inattention to details of the jobs or of the job search. Under stress, INFPs may become quite critical of others and themselves, and they may hold themselves back because they feel incompetent as they engage in this process. They can benefit from allowing their intuition to give them a new perspective on the possibilities available in the situation. They may also find it helpful to truly acknowledge their skills, as well as the importance of communicating those skills to others. In addition, INFPs can benefit from developing realistic expectations about the job search, and from objectively looking at the logical consequences of the various decisions they make. ""

       urlLink Near Future: The Hierophant :   Main meaning (positional)  You are about to be inducted into the society of teachers and healers.  The card in the Near Future position indicates which way the wind is blowing with regard to your situation. If you follow the Advice card, however, you can improve on or neutralize tendencies.   With the Hierophant in this position, it appears that you may soon receive some acknowledgment, certification or approval from experts in your field. You are about to be recognized for your efforts, long term dedication and the passion it has taken to absorb the wisdom of those who came before you.   In recognition of your dogged commitment, you are being brought into the inner circle. This is no accident. Trust the flow of events as they unfold. You may be needed to help with the transmission of sacred knowledge from the past into the future.   General meaning  Traditionally known as the Hierophant, this card refers to a Master and the learning of practical lessons from the study of Natural Law. This energy of this card points to some agent or resource that can reveal the secrets of life, the cycles of the moon and tides, the links between human beings and the heavens.   Because monasteries were the only places a person could learn to read and write in the middle ages, a Hierophant was one to whom a student would petition for entry. He was the one to set the curriculum for the neophyte's course of study.   Often pictured with the right hand raised in blessing, the Hierophant is linked with the ancient lineage of Melchezidek, initiator of the Hebrew priestly tradition, the one who passes on the teachings. All shamans of any tradition draw upon this archetype.

In beginnings there is a childlike innocence, and this innocence is filled with humility, filled with patience. On the spiritual path, these two virtues are paramount: humility and patience. To a beginner they are readily available.  A beginner knows he doesn't know, so there is humility. A beginner knows for certain something is going to happen, so there is patience. With humility and patience as his support, a beginner advances into the unknown to discover a glorious event yet to occur.  Even after achieving the goal of all spiritual practices, you cannot be indifferent to a new beginning. A beginning is forever full of magic, enchantment, and treasures to be explored. No matter what the occasion, a new beginning must be approached with a mystical awareness of its potential.""  - Swami Chidvilasanda

You get through tattered and torn around the edges. You get through wondering how you've managed to make it through this far. You get through hanging on for dear life. You get through shaken and shuddering and sheared of everything but your quivering mind and quaking heart, and the distant echo of a memory that this was why you came here. Though you think there has been some colossal mistake, inscrutably, incredibly, something in you knows that this is precisely what you came here so valiantly to endure: this merciless nakedness of heart and soul.

       urlLink CHINESE ART  AND GREEK ART  by Rumi  The Prophet said, 'There are some who see me by the same light in which I am seeing them. Our natures are one.  Without references to any strands of lineage, without refrences to texts or traditions, we drink the life-water together.'  Here's a story about that hidden mystery:  The Chinese and the Greeks were arguing  as to who were the better artists.  The king said,   'We'll settle this matter with a debate.'  The Chinese began talking, but the Greeks wouldn't say anything. They left.  The Chinese suggested then that they each be given  a room to work on with their artistry, two rooms facing each other and divided by a curtain.  The Chinese asked the king for a hundred colors, all the variations, and each morning they came to where the dyes were kept and took them all.  The Greeks took no colors.   'They are not part of our work.' They went to their room and began cleaning and polishing the walls.  All day every day they made those walls as pure and clear as an open sky.  There is a way that leads from all-colors to colorlessness. Know that the magnificent variety  of the clouds and the weather comes from the total simplicity of the sun and the moon.  The Chinese finished, and they were so happy. They beat the drums in the joy of completion.  The king entered the room, astonished by the gorgeous color and detail.  The Greeks then pulled the curtain dividing the rooms. The Chinese figures and images shimmeringly reflected on the clear Greek walls. They lived there, even more beautifully, and always changing in the light.  The Greek art is the sufi way. They don't study books of philosophical thought.  They make their loving clearer and clearer. No wantings, no anger. In that purity they receive and reflect the images of every moment, from here, from the stars, from the void.  They take them in as though they were seeing with the lighted clarity that sees them.  In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems.  You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art.  Drumsound rises on the air, its throb, my heart.  A voice inside that beats says,   ""I know you are tired,   but come. This is the way.""  Are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? Why would you refuse to give this joy to anyone? Fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! They swim the huge fluid freedom.

       Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front (excerpt)   Ask the questions that have no answers.  Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.  Say that your main crop is the forest  that you did not plant,  that you will not live to harvest. Say that the leaves are harvested  when they have rotted into the mold. Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.  Put your faith in the two inches of humus  that will build under the trees  every thousand years.   Listen to carrion -- put your ear  close, and hear the faint chattering  of the songs that are to come.  Expect the end of the world. Laugh.  Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful  though you have considered all the facts.  So long as women do not go cheap  for power, please women more than men. Ask yourself: Will this satisfy  a woman satisfied to bear a child?  Will this disturb the sleep  of a woman near to giving birth?   Go with your love to the fields.  Lie down in the shade. Rest your head  in her lap. Swear allegiance  to what is highest your thoughts. As soon as the generals and the politicos  can predict the motions of your mind,  lose it. Leave it as a sign  to mark the false trail, the way  you didn't go. Be like the fox  who makes more tracks than necessary,  some in the wrong direction.  Practice resurrection. ~ Wendell Berry   urlLink web version from panhala

The storm has the effect of clearing the air and suddenly reducing atmospheric tension. Deliverance is at hand. In the wake of a storm on land, deliverance appears in the form of new color and life, which bursts forth in all the fields and flowers. In the wake of a storm at sea, deliverance takes the form of land itself.  In the field of human relations, the rain of forgiveness washes the human landscape clean after a period of enmity and error. Great clarity of purpose and renewed vigor can follow the healing of old wounds. But care must be taken not to re-open these old wounds by moving too quickly. In the same way, it is important to return to normalcy first before moving ahead with new plans after periods of stress.  Following the resolution of a difficult situation, your first priority, should be to return to normal conditions as quickly as possible. Breathe a sigh of relief, but don't relax completely. It would be a mistake to re-awaken the sleeping dogs of the immediate past before the new situation has crystallized. Look ahead. Attend to any residual matters that need resolution, and do so as quickly as possible. Make a clean sweep of the past, move deliberately, and the future will bring good fortune.""

      ""At the new moon, the lunar gravity pulls water up, and causes the seeds to swell and burst. This factor, coupled with the increasing moonlight creates balanced root and leaf growth. This is the best time for planting above ground annual crops that produce their seeds outside the fruit. Examples are lettuce, spinach, celery, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and grain crops. Cucumbers like this phase also, even though they are an exception to that rule.  In the second quarter the gravitational pull is less, but the moonlight is strong, creating strong leaf growth. It is generally a good time for planting, especially two days before the full moon. The types of crops that prefer the second quarter are annuals that produce above ground, but their seeds form inside the fruit, such as beans, melons, peas, peppers, squash, and tomatoes. Mow lawns in the first or second quarter to increase growth.  After the full moon, as the moon wanes, the energy is drawing down. The gravitation pull is high, creating more moisture in the soil, but the moonlight is decreasing, putting energy into the roots. This is a favorable time for planting root crops, including beets, carrots, onions, potatoes, and peanuts. It is also good for perennials, biennials, bulbs and transplanting because of the active root growth. Pruning is best done in the third quarter, in the sign of Scorpio.  In the fourth quarter there is decreased gravitational pull and moonlight, and it is considered a resting period. This is also the best time to cultivate, harvest, transplant and prune. Mow lawns in the third or fourth quarter to retard growth.""  urlLink More on gardening by the moon phases...

I believe volunteering is an imporant first step for me in defining which direction I will take to do this.  Second, I feel I am ready and capable of being a support to people in Hospice. I experienced two losses which were eased by Hospice in Broward County. The Hospice workers gave incredible care to both of my grandmothers as they were approaching life's end and the volunteers who were there played a critical role. I will always remember the support one of the volunteers gave to my mother during that time just by being there to talk to her.   To sum it all up, I want to give back. I want to do it with my career and I want to start now.  Thank you for asking this question.

Find the leak in the tube, and check the corresponding area of the tire for glass, thorns, or other debris.  You should also check the rim for sharp edges that may cause flat tires.  Remove the old tube.  Inflate the new tube slightly. (Just enough to give it shape.)  Put the new tube inside the tire and insert the valve into the valve hole of the rim.  Mount the other side of the tire on the rim. It is best to only use your thumbs, but you may need to use tire levers.  Partially inflate the tire and check that the bead is evenly seated around the rim.  Inflate the tire to recommended pressure.  Put the wheel back on the bike and ride.

       urlLink What makes people ticklish? :  Dear Yahoo!: What makes people ticklish? Arden Dallas, Texas   Dear Arden: Being ticklish is a complicated trait rooted in our evolutionary past. Two searches, 'physiology + ticklish' and 'why are we ticklish,' turned up a number of articles that helped us understand this touchy, feely human feature.   Scientists suggest that being ticklish is our defense against creepy crawlies like spiders and bugs, a physiological response alerting us to a specific type of threat. That is why vulnerable parts of our bodies -- feet, chest, and armpits, are among the most ticklish.   While there is no question that being ticklish is neurological, scientists contend that it is also learned. One theory sees ticklishness as a personality-based response to perceived attack. Antsy folks may laugh uncontrollably at the lightest touch, or even without being touched at all, while folks made of sterner stuff won't budge during more aggressive tickle attacks.   If you close your eyes and try to remain calm while you are tickled, you can decrease panic, reduce giggles, and dull sensation. And, no matter how hard you try, it is nearly impossible to tickle yourself.   Tickling satisfies our human need to touch. Robert R. Provine, a professor of neuroscience and author of Quest for Laughter, sees the tickle as a form of communication between friends, family, and lovers, playing a key role in the evolution of social and sexual behavior. He points to chimps tickling each other during play, parents tickling little kids, and lovers tickling each other affectionately.   'If you think the social component is not important,' Provine says, 'Try tickling a stranger.'

       urlLink Osho Zen Tarot :  Friendliness  First meditate, be blissful, then much love will happen of its own accord. Then being with others is beautiful and being alone is also beautiful. Then it is simple, too. You don't depend on others and you don't make others dependent on you. Then it is always a friendship, a friendliness. It never becomes a relationship, it is always a relatedness. You relate, but you don't create a marriage. Marriage is out of fear, relatedness is out of love. You relate; as long as things are moving beautifully, you share. And if you see that the moment has come to depart because your paths separate at this crossroad, you say good-bye with great gratitude for all that the other has been to you, for all the joys and all the pleasures and all the beautiful moments that you have shared with the other. With no misery, with no pain, you simply separate. - Osho The White Lotus Chapter 10  The branches of these two flowering trees are intertwined, and their fallen petals blend together on the ground in their beautiful colors. It is as if heaven and earth are bridged by love. But they stand individually, each rooted in the soil in their own connection with the earth. In this way they represent the essence of true friends, mature, easy with each other, natural. There is no urgency about their connection, no neediness, no desire to change the other into something else. This card indicates a readiness to enter this quality of friendliness. In the passage, you may notice that you are no longer interested in all kinds of dramas and romances that other people are engaged in. It is not a loss. It is the birth of a higher, more loving quality born of the fullness of experience. It is the birth of a love that is truly unconditional, without expectations or demands.

Three baby bison were born in five days, culminating in the birth of Sunrise Spirit, a full-white female Saturday. Two other bison, both reddish brown, were born earlier in the month. One male, Wind Dancer, was born during such strong winds that he could barely stand.   The birth of a white buffalo is very meaningful to many Native Americans, who hold that white buffalo are sacred and will return during a period of disaster in the world. Plains Lakota lore says the birth of a female white buffalo heralds a time of enlightenment and healing, bringing all races together in peace, balance and harmony.""

       urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : Moment To Moment The past is no more and the future is not yet: both are unnecessarily moving in directions which don't exist. One used to exist, but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist. The only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is, his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now. That's the only right direction. Only such a man can enter into the golden gate. The present is the golden gate. Here-now is the golden gate. ...And you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious--no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. Only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present. A man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to see and enter the gate. Experience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated. Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 37  Commentary:  As this figure moves across the stones, he steps lightly and non-seriously, and at the same time absolutely balanced and alert. Behind the swirling, ever-changing waters we can see the shapes of buildings; there appears to be a city in the background. The man is in the marketplace but at the same time outside of it, maintaining his balance and able to watch it from above. This card challenges us to move away from our preoccupations with other spaces and other times, and stay alert to what is happening in the here and now. Life is a great ocean in which you can play if you drop all your judgments, your preferences and the attachment to the details of your long-term plans. Be available to what comes your way, as it comes. And don't worry if you stumble or fall; just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, have a good laugh, and carry on.

I always get a pack of matches for free along with the pack. My story is the same as tens of thousands of other smokers.

       Cancer Horoscope  Your skin may not be able to contain you now, as it feels like you are ready to shed whatever is now holding you back. As a snake outgrows its skin, you, too, have moved beyond the teachers and authorities that have brought you this far. But you're not going to escape without first finishing what you've started.     urlLink General Daily Overview  The Moon enters Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, at 6:02 am EDT -- thus beginning the cycle anew as it does every month. We feel the need to initiate action, to act on new feelings, to tackle a new project and in general, to jump in to circumstances before we know the consequences. Additionally, the Moon in Aries forms a tense square with Mars in Cancer, making us struggle with the question of action versus inaction. We feel ready to express our feelings, yet we tend to hold something back, as if our survival depended on it.

      The Seven Of Pentacles -- Marge Piercy  Under a sky the color of pea soup she is looking at her work growing away there actively, thickly like grapevines or pole beans as things grow in the real world, slowly enough. If you tend them properly, if you mulch, if you water, if you provide birds that eat insects a home and winter food, if the sun shines and you pick off caterpillars, if the praying mantis comes and the ladybugs and the bees, then the plants flourish, but at their own internal clock.  Connections are made slowly, sometimes they grow underground. You cannot tell always by looking what is happening. More than half the tree is spread out in the soil under your feet. Penetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows no trumpet. Fight persistently as the creeper that brings down the tree. Spread like the squash plant that overruns the garden. Gnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar.  Weave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses. Live a life you can endure: Make love that is loving. Keep tangling and interweaving and taking more in, a thicket and bramble wilderness to the outside but to us interconnected with rabbit runs and burrows and lairs.  Live as if you liked yourself, and it may happen: reach out, keep reaching out, keep bringing in. This is how we are going to live for a long time: not always, for every gardener knows that after the digging, after the planting, after the long season of tending and growth, the harvest comes.  ~ Marge Piercy

       urlLink Neurology (general): Eye twitch   Question: I was trying to find out why I have been having a constant twitching in my left eyelid. It is quite visable and extremely annoying. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks.  Answer: Twitching of the eye almost always occurs in the muscles of the eyelid. Because they press on the eye it may feel as though the eyeball itself is moving Minor eyelid twitches require no treatment as they usually resolve spontaneously. Reducing stress, using warm soaks, in some cases it occurs because of irritation in the eye, which results in twitching of the eyelid. However, if the eye is comfortable it is more likely that it is a simple muscle spasm, which may be related to stress or fatigue or in, many cases happen spontaneously without any known cause. Eye Twitching should resolve on its own it does not it certainly is worth a comprehensive eye examination to ensure that no other problem is occurring in the eye.

      Why does the world seem to be getting more fucked up every week?   urlLink Harper's Weekly Review (Harpers.org) :  ""Six American soldiers, including a general, were facing court martial over the torture and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison, which was famous for its torture chambers under Saddam Hussein. Photographs of the abuse were broadcast on U.S. television; one image depicted a hooded prisoner standing on a box with wires attached to his genitals. Other photos showed prisoners masturbating; several showed U.S. soldiers smiling and posing next to their victims. Some of the soldiers blamed mercenaries for the abuses; others said that military intelligence was in control of that cellblock. Photographs were published of British troops beating an Iraqi man and urinating on him; the pictures also showed a soldier striking the man in the genitals with a rifle; the victim's jaw was reportedly broken and his teeth were smashed before he was thrown off the back of a moving truck. President Bush condemned the abuse. ""Their treatment does not reflect the nature of the American people,"" he said. ""That's not the way we do things in America.""   The Urban Institute released a study showing that in some U.S. counties 30 percent of the population is in prison, and an abortion provider in Kansas City was accused of practicing fetal cannibalism. The United States used F-15E and F-16 warplanes, F-14 and F-18 fighter-bombers, AC-130 gunships, and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters to bomb Fallujah. British Tornados were also used. Some three dozen laser-guided 500-pound bombs were dropped, and at least one building was blown up by accident. A Cobra helicopter fired a missile at a mosque and knocked over its minaret. U.S. forces, fearing a public relations disaster, pulled back from the city and left a new Iraqi force in charge under the command of General Jasim Muhammad Saleh, who served in the Republican Guard under Saddam Hussein. There was some confusion among American officials, however, as to whether the general was really in charge and whether he had actually served in the Republican Guard. Iraq's Governing Council unveiled a new national flag that was immediately condemned for its strong resemblance to the flag of Israel, which features the same shade of blue.  ""Brother Guide"" Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya arrived in Brussels, along with his white stretch Mercedes limo and four female bodyguards wearing tight uniforms, to meet with European officials. He called on the United States and China to rid themselves of nuclear and chemical weapons. ""Hopefully,"" he said, ""nothing will force us to go back to the days when we used our cars and explosive belts."" Terrorists in Syria fought with police and blew up a bomb outside a former United Nations office in Damascus, and militants in Saudi Arabia attacked the offices of a Western engineering company and killed several people; one American engineer was dragged away behind a car. The United Nations Security Council voted to ban ""non-state actors"" from possessing nuclear weapons. Police killed more than 100 Muslim militants armed with machetes in southern Thailand. Vandals defaced 127 graves with swastikas and other Nazi symbols in a Jewish cemetery in Alsace, and the Anti-Defamation League released a report showing that European anti-Semitism is on the decline, though negative attitudes toward Israel are up. The Likud Party, in a referendum, rejected Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip, where a pregnant Israeli woman and her four daughters, ages two to 11, were murdered by Palestinian gunmen. Child abductions were on the rise in Afghanistan, and the United Nations was having a hard time recruiting peacekeepers for its mission in Haiti.  President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney met for several hours with the 9/11 commission, though they refused to permit the interview to be recorded or transcribed; two Democratic members of the commission had to leave early because they had other appointments. It was reported that more than $5 billion in antiterrorism money for local governments and agencies has been held up by red tape, and that last year the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control assigned only four employees to work on terrorist cases; in contrast, almost two dozen were investigating violations of the Cuban embargo. Since 1990, the office has opened 93 investigations into terrorist finances and 10,683 relating to Cuba. President Bush declined to investigate China's unfair trade practices, and ten new countries joined the European Union. Bosnian Serb officials revealed six new mass graves containing victims of the Srebrenica massacre.  California banned Diebold's electronic voting machines, and experts said that the United States is losing its dominance in science and technology. Scientists developed a type of computer made of DNA that they hope could someday diagnose and treat diseases from inside the particular human cells that require treatment. SARS continued to spread in China. Researchers discovered a molecule, used by some cancer tumors, that prevents cells from dying. Archaeologists found an underground Egyptian maze filled with mummies, and scientists discovered that women tend to marry men who look like their fathers.

        urlLink Abandoned Whizhost customer FAQ    Due to the overwhelming number of questions generated by former Whizhost customers,  PLEASE look for answers here rather than asking by e-mail.   Q  Could you let me know when my website that were hosted by Whizhost will be back on-line, and if there is anything I need to do?    A  According to the correspondence we have had with Whizhost, they have abandoned their customers. If you need immediate account set-up send a message to migration@sb-host.com   Q  Do you have any information on why they have disappeared?    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  What are the chances of getting my Whizhost accts restored? And what about backups? I have clients with databases etc on their Whizhost-hosted account and they need to retrieve the data from them. Also, retrieve emails. What are the chances of this and what timeframe are we looking at.     A  Sorry restoration and/or backups are unlikely. You will find current information on our forums   Q  Will we still be able to host free of charge for the rest of the contract we had at Whizhost?    A  Sorry. we are unable to provide free hosting.   Q  We had 8 domains hosted on the Whizhost server. Will it be possible to continue with this kind of a multiple domain hosting plan?   A  We have adopted 2 new  flexible  packages that will provide similar features, QUALITY support, and competitive prices.  contact us if you have special needs   Q  I am also wondering if you have contact information for Whizhost?    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  Will any data be recovered from Whizhost?    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  Has all of our site data been lost, or should we anticipate full recovery, and if so... when?   A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  I had 9 accounts and 9 domains with Whizhost, I just paid them last week 300.00 for 2 years more of hosting, how do I get my money back    A  You will find current information on our forums   Q  Is the $140.00 for hosting starting now, or after my term expires with Whizhost?    A  Your billing period will begin 14 days following your account migration We wish we could do more,  but we're forced to limit our Whizhost ""victims"" offering due to the overwhelming abuse that Whizhost has imposed. This should provide ample time to decide what you want to do. We HOPE you'll consider staying with us.    Q  I have 2 reseller accounts with Whizhost with unlimited mysql databases, unlimited emails accounts, 6000MB hard disk space and 20 domains. I understand you guys take the customers of Whizhost but I have my own customers and they are very angry with this situation. There are a lot of people involved in this trouble.    A  We understand your situation and are here to help. Unfortunately ""Unlimited"" anything  is not an option. We at SB-Host believe offering any type of  ""Unlimited"" services is unethical. If you have specific requirements, contact us. Our offerings are flexible.   Q  I would like a refund of my Whizhost fees. This is all totally unacceptable, the MIGHT restore data? When I signed up it said 99.9% downtime and generators and backups and all that. Now your saying I have to set everything back up with some other company and MIGHT get my data. I dont have the data locally, so you just lost everything? Where are these backups Please refund my monies for all service as I did not receive the service you promoted.    A  Sorry. We didn't take your money, nor did we make any promises we did not keep. Although paying more does not guarantee better service, in most cases deals that are ""too good to be true,"" usually are. We believe Whizhost qualifies in the ""too good to be true"" category.  Q  I had a pre-paid Whizhost account, and I'm confused. Do I upload my files onto your server, or are they supposed to come back online?   A  Due to  the lack of cooperation by other ""players"" in this problem, We do not recommend waiting for the Whizhost server to come back online.   Q  Once all this is settled, we would like a refund of service as my customers are all finding other providers. This was all handled so unprofessional....    A  Refunds are unlikely.  ""Unprofessional"" is an understatement.

This site states that ""a review of numerous research studies focusing on smoking cessation has concluded that while women may suffer greater relative risks of smoking-related diseases than do men, they tend to have more difficulty than men in quitting smoking.""  I am sure all that's true but here are some good reasons to remember when the craving is bad (like it is right now).  Reproductive health: Women smokers are at higher risk for pregnancy complications, early menopause, infertility, miscarriage, pre-term delivery, stillbirth, infant death and having low birth-weight babies. Smoking also doubles a woman's risk of cervical cancer.   Children's health: Smoking increases the chances of sudden infant death syndrome, infant and perinatal deaths, learning disorders, attention deficit disorder and disruptive behavior. ""If you bathe a fetus' brain in nicotine for nine months, it's clear there are profound effects,"" says Dr. Timothy McAfee, executive director for health promotion and disease prevention for Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound.   Hormones: Smoking causes women to enter menopause sooner and interrupts the menstrual cycle. ""It's also well established that the aging processskin and wrinklesis substantially faster in women who smoke,"" McAfee adds.

       urlLink Painting Over Plastic Laminate :  ""Is there any way to paint over dark-brown plastic-laminate kitchen cabinets? I can't replace or reface them right now, and they're just too dark for the room. I'd appreciate any tips."" - Lyndee, via e-mail  John says: If you're looking at ugly laminate, refacing it with not-so-ugly laminate is the best course of action, from the standpoint of durability and ease of care. But if it's paint you want, the answer to your question is yes, as long as the laminate is well-adhered and in good condition. First, I'd wipe down all the surfaces with a solvent such as xylol to get rid of dirt and grease. Be sure to don chemical-resistant gloves, wear a respirator, shut off any pilot lights, and kick out the dog - this is powerful stuff. Then scuff up all the surfaces with 150-grit sandpaper and wipe them down again with xylol. Next, you want a primer that will adhere tenaciously and serve as a good base for paint. The one I use comes from X-I-M, a company that manufactures bonding primers; they have several solvent-based products suitable for your application. I find that the spray-applied primer actually holds better than the brush-on version. Allow two or three days for the primer to cure before sanding it lightly with 220-grit paper. Then you can apply either a latex or oil-based paint; I prefer oil in kitchens because it gives a smoother finish and is easier to clean.  (John Dee, a painting and decorating contractor based in Concord, Mass., has restored finishes on five This Old House projects.)

       Rush for surnames produces 500 Genghis Khans  By Oliver August  MONGOLIANS have been ordered to invent their own surnames, after generations of living with just one name on the orders of their former Soviet masters.  Hundreds, pondering what to call themselves, daily besiege a small office in the centre of their capital where identity documents are issued. Held back by armed guards outside, some opt for surnames like Seven Drunk Men that hint at Mongolia's national pastime.   Others prefer to adopt the name of Genghis Khan, still the mightiest of Mongols, who now has 500 namesakes in Ulan Bator.   When communism crumbled in 1990 the ban on family names was lifted but many nomadic herders who roam between Siberia and the Gobi desert continue to refer to each other only by single names.   Now, to fight incest and make official records more intelligible, the Government has set a deadline of June 27 for all 2.5 million Mongolians to choose a family name on pain of a fine equivalent to several months' salary.   ""We are returning to our ancient traditions,"" the Defence Minister said. The result is a stampede to state registration offices by Mongolians wearing felt hats and embroidered riding boots.  urlLink more...

        urlLink A GLASS OF MILK :  One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk.   He drank it slowly, and then asked, ""How much do I owe  you?""  ""You don't owe me anything,"" she replied. ""Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness.""  He said..... ""Then I thank you from my heart.""  As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit. Many years later that same young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease.  Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.  Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his  best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to her case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared  to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for  it all. Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side  of the bill. She read these words.....""Paid in full with one glass of milk""  (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: ""Thank You, God, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands.""   There's a saying which goes something like this: Bread cast on the waters comes back to you. The good deed you do today may benefit you or someone you love at the least expected time.

       The Journey   Above the mountains the geese turn into the light again  Painting their black silhouettes on an open sky.  Sometimes everything has to be enscribed across the heavens  so you can find the one line already written inside you.  Sometimes it takes a great sky to find that  small, bright and indescribable wedge of freedom in your own heart.  Sometimes with the bones of the black sticks left when the fire has gone out  someone has written something new in the ashes of your life.  You are not leaving you are arriving.  ~ David Whyte

From entire cities and prefectures declaring themselves against the Japanese work ethic to men and women seeking a change in the rhythms of their daily routines, Japan is questioning its tendency to overwork, undersleep and take an extreme approach to everything. And it's not just young people like Watanabe who are reconsidering their relationships to fellow humans, food and the environment. All of Japan, it seems, is heeding the call to  go Slow .""

       urlLink Warning: nicotine seriously improves health  Robin McKie, science editor Sunday July 18, 2004 The Observer   Nicotine could soon be rehabilitated as a treatment for schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as hyperactivity disorders.  Research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders.   Some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of Parkinson's symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics.   'A whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,' said Dr Dan McGehee, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago. 'However, such benefits do not justify smoking. The lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide. On the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.'   Nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure. This effect leads to a person's addiction.   More than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics. But smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent. 'The assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,' said McGehee. 'They are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.'   This point is backed by Dr Tony George, of Yale University. 'Smoking is a marker for psychopathology,' he states in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.   Similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells.   'Either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in Parkinson's, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy Parkinson's cells,' said McGehee. 'Either way, the effect is noticeable.'

       urlLink Installing Love  - Milpitas Mom's Favorite Jokes CS Rep: Can you install LOVE?  Customer: I can do that. I'm not very technical, but I think I am ready to install now. What do I do first?  CS Rep: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your HEART ma'am?  Customer: Yes I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running?  CS Rep: What programs are running ma'am?  Customer: Let me see....I have PASTHURT.EXE, LOWESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE,and RESENTMENT.COM running right now.  CS Rep: No problem. LOVE will automatically erase PASTHURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOWESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGHESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ma'am?  Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how?  CS Rep: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM have been completely erased.  Customer: Okay, I'm done. LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal?  CS Rep: Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message?  Customer: Yes I do. Is it completely installed?  CS Rep: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTS in order to get the upgrades.  Customer: Oops...I have an error message already. What should I do?  CS Rep: What does the message say?  Customer: It says ""ERROR 412 - PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS."" What does that mean?  CS Rep: Don't worry ma'am, that's a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTS but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in nontechnical terms it means you have to ""LOVE"" your own machine before it can ""LOVE"" others.  Customer: So what should I do?  CS Rep: Can you find the directory called ""SELF-ACCEPTANCE""?  Customer: Yes, I have it.  CS Rep: Excellent, you are getting good at this.  Customer: Thank you.  CS Rep: You're welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to the ""MYHEART"" directory: FORGIVESELF.DOC, SELFESTEEM.TXT, REALIZEWORTH.TXT, and GOODNESS.DOC. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete SELFCRITIC.EXE from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back.  Customer: Got it. Hey! My HEART is filling up with really neat files. SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that WARMTH.COM, PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM are copying themselves all over my HEART!  CS Rep: Then LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. One more thing before I go...  Customer: Yes?  CS Rep: LOVE is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you meet. They will in turn share it with other people and they will return some really neat modules back to you.  Customer: I will. Thank you for your help.

       urlLink Free I-Ching Reading :: I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes : ""When the light goes down, it may be wise to become invisible. The image is of fresh darkness, the period after the sun has gone down or the fire has gone out. There is still much activity left over from the light of day, and movements in the outer world are at their most dangerous. Even the smallest sound, the faintest glow of light, can attract unwanted attention.  When the darkness of stupidity reigns, it is best that your own brilliance stay 'hidden under a bushel basket.' That is, your thoughts and efforts should be quiet and self-contained, and protected, as much as possible, from harmful external influences.  Whatever you do, don't let yourself be swept along on the current of conventional wisdom when dangerous uncertainties exist. Try not to become too depressed or anxious; this period will pass. Just endure it for now and inwardly preserve your self-confidence, while outwardly remaining cooperative and flexible. The time to assert yourself will come. Avoid looking too far ahead if you have not yet achieved your goals. That only brings regret and longing, which can eat away at your inner resources.  Be cautious and reserved. Control yourself. Do not needlessly awaken dormant forces of opposition. During dark, unsettled periods, it is best to step gingerly around the sleeping dogs.""

       urlLink Making Handmade Paper in 10 easy steps : Simple Recipe:   Many  types of paper  that can be used include:  Computer Paper (unprinted)  Newspaper (If you want a grayish colored paper)  Magazines  Egg Cartons  Old Cards (For heavier paper)  Toilet Paper  Paper Bags  Non Waxed Boxes (Pre-soak in warm water)  Office Paper  Tissue Paper (For finer paper)  Typing Paper  Napkins  Construction Paper    Supplies you'll need:   Sponge  Window Screening (mold)  Wood Frame (old picture frame can be used too) (deckle)  Plastic Basin/Tub (Large enough to totally immerse frame)  Blender/Food Processor (For making paper pulp)  White Felt or Flannel Fabric  Staples or Tacks (For tacking screen on frame)  Liquid starch (optional)    Instructions:   1. Select the pieces of paper to be recycled. You can even mix different types to create your own unique paper.  2. Rip the paper into small bits, and place into the blender. (about half full). Fill the blender with warm water. Run the blender slowly at first then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well blended. ( 30 -40 seconds) Check that no flakes of paper remain. If there are, blend longer.  3. The next step is to make a mold. The mold, in this case, is made simply by stretching fiberglass screen (plain old door and window screen) over a wooden frame and stapling it. It should be as tight as possible.  4. Fill the basin about half way with water. Add 3 blender loads of pulp. (the more pulp you add the thicker the finished paper will be) Stir the mixture.  5. Now is the time to add the liquid starch for sizing.(This is not necessary but if the paper is going to be used for writing on, you should add some, the starch helps to prevent inks from soaking into the paper fibers.) Stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp.  Place the mold into the pulp and then level it out while it is submerged. Gently wiggle it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen looks even.  6. Slowly lift the mold up until it is above the level of the water. Wait until most of the water has drained from the new paper sheet. If the paper is very thick, remove some pulp from the tub. If it is too thin, add more pulp and stir the mixture again.  7. When the mold stops dripping, gently place one edge on the side of a fabric square (felt or flannel square). Gently ease the mold down flat, with the paper directly on the fabric. Use a sponge to press out as much water as possible. Wring the excess water from the sponge back into the large plastic tub.  8. Now comes the tricky part. Hold the fabric square flat and slowly lift the edge of the mold. The wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. If it sticks to the mold, you may have pulled to fast or not pressed out enough water. It takes a little practice. You can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point.  9. Repeat the steps above, and stack the fabric squares on a cookie sheet. Save one fabric square to place on the top of the stack to cover the last piece of paper. Use another cookie sheet to press the remaining water out of the stack. (do this outside or in the bathtub, it can make a mess)  10. After you press the stack, gently separate the sheets. They can be dried by hanging on a clothesline or laying them out on sheets of newspaper. When they have dried peel them off the fabric and voila! you have paper!

It was a month or two before I went to work in the USA which would have made a much more interesting blog had I done it.  Tomorrow I'm off to London for my induction meeting at my new company. I'm so relieved to leave NCorp that I haven't really given the new place much thought. I'm sure it will be great, I was really into the new place 3 months ago when I got the job but  urlLink the pangalactic bellwether in miserable notice periods  has kind of taken the sparkle off it a bit.  At least the train ride down will give me time to write to manda - haven't been in touch since the wedding - bad pen pal!

       Well, I decided to start this site after some bad customer support experiences with  urlLink http://www.atkins.com  in their ""My Atkins"" area.  Their site is so slow and it's been impossible for me to upload my ""before"" photo to help me see my progress visually.  I figure it's probably better to have my own weight loss journal so that I can get exactly what I want out of it.      So, to tell about my situation...  I'm 25 years old, and I've been trying to lose weight since May 2003.  My highest weight ever was 400 pounds.  I've lost 57 pounds so far and it's been quite a journey.  I've had all sorts of eating habits..  for several months I was vegetarian because I got sick from fatty foods after having gallbladder surgery.  My gallbladder was taken out in July 2003 after I'd lost about 30 pounds rather quickly from low calorie dieting.  My doctor who did that surgery said that the pain might return because after physically looking at the stuff he took out of me he just didn't think that the stones were causing the kind of pain that I felt.  I don't really regret having the surgery since those stones had to pass at some point.  My dad had a stone pass once and it got stuck in a duct and he had to be hospitalized for a while, it was a really traumatic experience.  I'm glad I'm not going to have to go through that.     On July 12 2004 I started the Atkins Nutritional Approach because of course that pain returned along with a lot of bowel symptoms.  I had read somewhere that eating low-carbohydrates can help ease the pain with some people who have Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  Boy were they right.  Every time I thought back to all the times I got sick while eating, it was always after eating a bowl of mashed potatoes or a bunch of bread.  I talked this over with a gastroenterologist and he gave me the information that I needed to make a life-change to my eating habits that will make me not feel so sick anymore.  He agrees that I most likely have Irritable Bowel Syndrome from discussing my history, dating all the way back to my childhood.  During the last month I've already had just about every other medical condition ruled out.  IBS can not be tested for.. it is a ""functional"" syndrome, meaning that there's no disease present, my body just works differently in a way that can be painful if I am not careful with the way that I eat.     So, I've been doing a sort of modified Atkins plan for one week, and I already feel 95% better.  I've lost 2 inches off my measurements already (wow!) although the scale is playing games with my head.  That's probably due to all the water and that will come down with time as well.  I feel a little bit better every day.  Two weeks ago, I didn't want to get out of bed because of the excruciating abdominal pain.  Now I am able to live my life again.     Right now I'm doing a modified Atkins induction.  This means less than net 20 carbs a day, except I'm eating extra fiber foods than induction allows, such as spinach and broccoli, and I'm taking metamucil up to the recommended 25-30 grams of fiber a day.  First thing in the morning I have 36 ounces of water, split three ways, 2 doses of 17g Miralax (polyethylene glycol.. ewww!), and the third 12 oz glass of water is my first metamucil of the day.  This morning routine is part of my bowel program given to me by my doctor last week.      If I dont follow the program the way that I do, I will get really, really sick just like I was before.  Besides, the vitamins from my fiber veggies are really good for me.  Speaking of vitamins, I take a One a Day Carb Smart in the afternoon right before lunch time.   The motivation not to eat some french fries or a piece of bread, is the constant knowledge that eliminating them from my diet is the only reason that I am not in pain anymore.     I track all of my food/exercise using Fitday PC which I bought at  urlLink http://www.fitday.com  .  They have a free version that you can track your stuff through their website, but I like the PC version better because it has a lot more flexibility and options.      Here are some links for articles about Atkins and IBS, explaining why I am feeling a lot better:     urlLink http://atkins.com/Archive/2002/1/11-771731.html       urlLink http://atkins.com/Archive/2002/2/12-234348.html

      with each and every passing day its hard to imagine your going away... i still wake up every day cherishing your presence in a special way... no matter where i am or what i'm doing your always there in my heart... you never leave my mind, or eyes, i don't even try it would be to hard....  each minute away seems like a whole day and a different place.... each hour is spent picturing your smile and your face.... each thought becomes physical, as i race to make it home.... excited to just see your face, not have to talk on the phone....  i realize when i walk through the door i've been dreaming all day.... your more beautiful than i could ever dream now that we're face to face... as i wrap my arms around you and cherish we're in the same place... alls i can think of is your passionate kiss, and how i've longed for its taste....  its time to relax now so we sit down and vent about our days... we talk about all we've done, and how we missed each others face.... we spend our evenings together whoever said they needed space.... we wrap around each other as we drift away to our dreams... i'm laying next to the only girl i want how bad can life be.....  to many this is boring and just seems like killing time.... to me this is heaven and just being with what is mine.... listening to her breathe in my ear, knowing just then shes fine.... we might be lame laying there all curled.... but i wouldn't change a thing, i'm the happiest man in the world....

      today was cool. i woke up this morning @ 9:30 and got dressed, just then i decided that salleh looked cold so i laid back in bed with her to keep her warm for a few more minutes... fast forward to 12:30... i woke up a second time... undressed took a shower .... then as i was leaving sally muttered... ""what about mcdonalds"" with her sleepy voice still sleeping in bed... she wanted some breakfast or lunch .... so i left here and went and got us some grub when  i got back we ate together and i left for work.  she stayed home and then at 4 went to work.... blah thats done now.  i went to work then went to my boy kewons house and hooked up a computer.... saw his pitbulls ... after all of that i drove home and on the way sally called me and wanted me to come up there and see her... so i did.  i had the smoke house chicken dinner... after i ate that i went and smoked a cigerette with her in the backroom where she said to me, ""if i get caught i'm getting fired.."" heh see what she will do for a cigerette with me? hahah i'd like to think it was because i was there but i just think she needed a cigerette... :P  anywho now i'm home .... and i went out and bought 8 things of red bull and a 5th of vodka... and her and i are going to drink and play match.... for the first time in a minute her and i are going to have our alone night and i'm like so looking forward to it.... a night where her and i can make each other laugh and giggle... then by the end of the night with all of those intoxicants inside of us we will be going to bed... or at least trying.... so this defintly could be a good night from what i see so far... i'm totally excited.... okay here she is.... haha complaining about my pop she carried in getting on her shirt....

      so far today has been quite interesting.  i arrived at work to find that one of my loans was ready to be processed and closed, which means lots of money coming my way real quick.  then i got paid for another deal, sally came down to my office and we went to the bank together to deposit the check into our account.  she just now left to work from here and is working the majority of the evening most likely.  i think i'm gonna head home here in a bit, possibly go tanning on the way back... hmmmm ya know fuck it... i think i'm gonna have 'steve time' and go ahead and do that shit.    things have been really ..... stressful lately i'm not sure why but.... in the words of eminem... sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders everyones leaning on me.....  i'm gonna pull through and be victorious though... i mean fuck, i don't have a choice.  i have people that are depending on me... so i have too.    sometimes life just seems like it would be so much easier with out any obligations except for myself, but then i realize that easier is not always better... and sometimes when you have obligations they make you achieve more.... i wouldn't trade my obligations for nothing.  my obligations are human and alive... and i love em both... but fuck... heh.... (peanut & salleh).  well fuck i better get out of here and get to the tanning salon before traffic gets crazy... so i'm on my way out.... peace!

      *yawn* i apologize for the lack of updates, but you must excuse me for the procrastination.  things have been so fucking hectic as of lately it is almost even hard to imagine.  i've been going through some things that i'm finally coming to terms with and being able to accept and make the best of it, the last thing that has been on my mind is this website unfortunately.    but things are starting to look better (dare i say it?), so hopefully i can continue my habit that i once had and keep posting here... i wish i could just vent and let you guys know what's been going on .... but its   private  .  trust me... i would tell you if i thought there was a way.    sally and i are great - i'm sure that is what you guys are immediately thinking .... no we are not broken up... she still lives here.... we are still together... and most importantly we are still happy :)  i guess my problems have just been **my** problems.... having a lot of ""reality checks"" and realizing i'm not where i want to be in life with this mortgage business - so i'm in the process now of trying to do something to change it... so that my work can accommodate my lifestyle that i will be having here shortly when i start school........  basically the world has just been stressful and the last thought on my head has been this site ;)  hope to be posting more now...

       ""We don't live in the world of reality, we live in the world of how we perceive reality.""  Bryan Singer, director of ""The Usual Suspects""   today was interesting.  i really don't know what too say about it... i woke up feeling good considering what i did to my body the night before with drinking, sally on the other hand hardly could pull herself out of the bed.  anywho the majority of the day i spent laying on the couch with sally pretty much telling one another our hopes dreams and regret for drinking as much the night before.   so fuck i'm feeling wierd.  *sigh* i don't even know where to start.  what happens when you cherish something so special, and it is only special because of something unique... i mean that is what makes it ... ""special"".  so what happens when you begin to see that vision of the unique quality in that special person changing beyond your control.  the person has several different qualities which make them so special, but this one quality almost defies the person to your heart.  possibly a quality that opens the door to your heart.  blah blah blah... i don't know where i'm going with this... or if i even wanna go on with this.... but none the less ....  it boils down to the fact, that no matter what i'm feeling or why i'm feeling it.... even if it makes sense to me... i can't react to it based on selfish reasons.....  but sometimes.... i just want to feel like... i'm worth a piece of sacrafice... because ... to me.... my special person is worth the ultimate sacrafice.. and if i would lay that down with out ever questioning a thing or think of being selfish... for something so little, why can't i feel that way?  its selfish in its self... and blah .... blah .... blah.  i'm going now...

      dear monday, i hate you. i always have. but i need you, and never have.    it's monday and here we are again, a new week that no one wants to experince.  i'm at work, after tearing myself apart from sally this morning who only wanted me to be there with her and not leave.... she sat by the window as i was leaving and made me feel bad.. it was cute - but then i had to convince her that we need money and i don't make money by watching her put on make up... i wish i did... well who doesn't.  so now i'm at work and i'm still waiting on my mom to get some paper work to me....   this weekend sally and i just chilled, begining with friday night it was an early night - we both fell alsleep rather early ..... she worked all night.  saturday night we got really intoxicated and i really can't recall much of saturday night because that is how drunk we were.  sunday we laid together on the couch and watched a documentary on tupac and biggie, then fell alsleep watching the oscars.  haha anywhoooooo.  last night i decided that i'm going to start a new corporation.  like an online mortgage loan officer.  it is still in the works of being planned and cordinated, but hopefully in the next few weeks i'm able to compile enough resources and information in order to get this put together.  this could only make me more money, by providing a central location where people can go and fill out an online loan application, recieve a user name and password, so that they are able to login at any time and check the status of the pending loan application - additionally any time a change happens with their loan application the system will email them and make the client aware of the changes.   i am learning that advertising is such a complicated, yet simple task.  to advertise you are gambling.  you are putting a lot of assets into the marketing campaign with only hope and faith that there will be a profitable return from it.  *sigh*.  i hope that this works out for me...i guess you guys will be able to come along my journey in starting this and getting it off the ground..... oh yea and if you have any hints or advice.. you can share that too.... peace.

      as i pondered what today had to offer me i realized that i'm not even 100% positive as to what this day they call ""Memorial Day"" signifies.. so I did some research.  now today is a very very important day for many families in america, who have been unable to smell, speak, hear, touch, their loved ones due to loosing them in a war and as a former soldier myself i suppose that if i were to have ever died in combat that i would want to be remembered on more than one occasion a year (my birthday).  its sad really, as you drive up and down the streets, turn on your radio, this holiday has become more recognized for a ""4 day party"" than its intended meaning.    am i guilty?  of course i'm guilty i attempted to party all weekend myself, but now as i sit here and reflect on things and try to remain perceptive into other peoples memorial day weekends, it almost saddens me to think of the family that has lost a love one in a war whether decades ago, or recently.  as they drive down the streets they see the weekend slumber and every one smiling having a great time enjoying their 4 day weekend - only wishing that they too could be doing the same thing sharing this weekend with the love one they lost.  as they turn on their radio to take away this haunting, disturbing, creepy feeling they are consumed with club and party promotions by the radio stations who are taking this weekend and its purpose and converting it into some sort of lucrative toss up to make some money as they promote a club.    i'm lucky, that i'm able to celebrate this weekend and not have to reflect back on any one in particular that i've lost - but how unfortunate for those who do not share that same luck.  we raise our flags, start the grill, crack a beer and our weekend has started, the celebration, has started. we as a society have lost sight of the meaning of this weekend, and i just hope that one day possibly next year i can make my own first step towards actually making it... a memorial day...and reserving my celebration for the day that truly is intended for it, independence day.  cool quote i found:  "" Soldier, rest! Thy warfare o'er, Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking, Dream of battled fields no more. Days of danger, nights of waking. ""   ~Sir Walter Scott   quote found @  urlLink memorial day memorial..   - goodnight.

      in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?  well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.  in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.  in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn't.  now i'm having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.  i'm having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.  now i'm living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.  okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault.    then on top of that i'm having to deal with this new...""rule"".  you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month ""off of me"" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).  In a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be ""her choice"" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.  so i mean her decision can't shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?  well i'm still not feeling ""settled"" with all of it.  Something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say ""okay we don't mind this now, you took a month off of him"" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don't know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i'm even more at loss... really... blah i just don't know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we'll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i'm counting...   keep ya updated.  latah.

      today was a pretty simple day.  went to pick up  jessica a new friend of mine at her house way out in the ghetto right off of 8 mile.  well she don't live in the ghetto but you have to pass through it to get to where she does live.  anywho picked her up... got lost on the way home but i finally got back on track and found the park i was looking for.. we went to the park for a little while and let capone right wild, that was fun, he enjoyed it - we just walked and talked... that was kind of peaceful.  we ended up watching dave chapelles hbo special, she had never seen it - so that was a lot of fun we did ALOT of laughing.  after that we were about to leave, and mike came up with some weed.  its funny how when you least expect it someone pulls weed out of no where isn't it?  so we smoked - then i drove her home... and got home a little bit ago from that journey.   thats all my day really consisted of, and all it will consist of, because now i'm going to bed - because i'm fucking tired.   here is a picture i took today of capone  and jess  - cute.     awwww capone and i have a  new friend we like to hang out with :)   here is a picture of her and i watching dave chappelles hbo special...      shes good people.   -goodnight

       i saw the feeling close to my eye coming out from where it use to hide if i said i wasn't enjoying it that'd be a lie the question is who are you and why?  i only expected a brief encounter and a good friend never thought that i would have deeper desires for you that i now write down with my pen but here it comes there you are and here i go again.  captivated by your mind, held back by your eyes, embraced by our time, i'm not going to fight this or hold back i'm going to let it shine.

      so i went to see 'fahrenheit 911'. it's very impressive, and i certainly recommend that everyone go see it. some of it(oregon state police, etc)seems a bit unnecessary, but the vital and necessary stuff is profoundly vital and necessary. the part of the film that details the involvement between the bush family and the bin laden's and the saudi's is so disturbing that it makes my head ache. some VERY well documented and supported facts: 1-when george bush started his first oil company one of his biggest investors was the bin-laden family(yes, osama bin laden's family). 2-the bush family has received over $1.4 billion dollars from the saudi's and from the bin-laden family. 3-the saudi ambassador to the u.s is an 'unofficial' member of the bush family, and was invited to dinner at the white house on september 13th, 2001. 4-on september 13th over 50 members of the bin-laden family and citizens of saudi arabia were allowed to leave the united states without being questioned by the fbi, even though air traffic was shut down in the united states. 5-on september 11th, 2001 george bush senior and other members of the carlyle group(including members of the bin laden family and citizens of saudi arabia)watched on television as the twin towers were attacked by hijacked planes. 6-almost all references to saudi involvement in 9-11 have been blacked out by the bush administration. go see this movie, and if you doubt what i say then do a little research and you'll quickly realize that we have suffered through an administration(bush's)that is profoundly corrupt in ways that we never could have even imagined. bush, cheney, halliburton, enron, the bin-laden's, the house of saud, and the hundreds of billions of dollars made from oil(iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)are why we went to war. there were no wmd's in iraq, there were no nascent nuclear programs in iraq, there was no al qaeda presence in iraq. the sad and tragic truth is that we went to war in iraq for oil profits. that's it, and now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt. and it's utterly disgusting.   urlLink click here for showtimes and listings.   -goodnight

      well after two days of being completely intoxicated its good to have a day that i'm able to come to my senses and relax.  i honestly haven't done anything today, and do not have any plans to do anything.  i've sat on my ass the majority of the night watching the entire season 1 of dave chapelle on dvd.    i got moved out of my parents house today - the only thing i have left there now is mah dog which i pick up in the morning, i didn't want to bring him over here and let him get in the way and shit soooo he is still at mom and dads with his brother sam.  ha! he loves it there its great.  anywho... so i got the majority of my stuff out of there and just been sittin down most the evening - @ around 9 my friend sarah came over and watched a few episodes with me - she has to work tomorrow @ 7 so she took off about 20 minutes ago.. so that was kind of cool.   so now mike and i are just kind of finishing up the dvd, and then i'm probably going to go in the bedroom and crash and burn because the past two nights have just killed me.  i haven't had as much fun as i've had in the past three weeks in the past year.  its been a fucking riot.  oh yeah... and i finally cut the last bit of communication i had with .... her....  i finally blocked her .  God life is going way to good right now... I FUCKING LOVE IT.  I've added a link on the right hand side of the page there that links to where i will be posting new pictures and what not.  so enjoy that link :P there are already pictures from tuesday and wends night.  enjoy it.  -cheers to the good life.

      i sat in a star bucks parking lot allowing the love of my life to enter my heart only for exactly one year later it to be empty and cold... yet as empty and cold as it is... it still beats... and still holds an empty spot that needs to be filled...to say i will not love again... is kind of like saying i'll never smile again... then one day someone just comes by... and takes you by suprise.  i got so many things accomplished today i was quite impressed with myself.  i ended the day at mikes house, where we spent a few hours over there just bullshitting - then we went over our boy nicks house had a beer or two ... played some darts... i went to arbys because i was FUCKING hungry.  i'm home and its 11:20 - i've got an early day tomorrow - one that i'm not looking to forward too, but i am that pay check.  christ i like making my own money and it being all mine what a fucking difference in life style... i'm learning how to be selfish all over again... possibly by the end of the week i just might be a selfish person who knows? heh nah i'm just kidding... there is nothing i could buy myself that would give me more happiness then it does when i buy for....or use to buy for... ahhh shit it doesnt matter.   so far this is my week thats been planned:  ~ wends - JD's ~ fri - Big Secret Party that I know nothing about but i'm really excited for it... ? ~ sat - Recover from the party....  sounds fun eh?  okay i'm off to bed to catch some shut eye so that i'm able to function tomorrow....  -goodnight

      second post of the day.... but i just found two cool things i felt the need to share.  as i was sitting bored looking for something to do / or something to read i came across a website that a girl made devoted to her boyfriend.  it sort of reminded me of the old envyme.org - yet this had a rich taste about it.  somewhere on the site i found a simple writing she had wrote about him, and it choked the shit out of me.  so i'm sharing it.    My love. My one true love. I wake up for this everyday. I breathe for this. I'm happy because of him. The smell of his hair. His family. His cats. His sense of humor. His eyes. His sweet attitude. His hands. His ""uh- huh""s and free back rubs. Everything about him. I love it all. He completes me & theres nowhere else I'd rather be then in his arms, with the title ""girlfriend"". I'm glad were not arguing.  I'm glad were happy.  I'm glad we have eachother to talk to.  I'M JUST HAPPY. & IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.    now if you notice there was not a lot of creativity put into this, there was not a lot of fancy words, or an effort to rhyme, this was... i'm going to sit down... and just write how i feel.  amazing.    the second thing   i want to share - i've heard plenty of times but one of my readers sent it to me, and after the past few weeks - for the first time in my life... i can honestly say... it fits...     don't cry because its over, smile because it happened....    this only fits because i have no regrets with sal, in fact i'm happy it happened.  i learned a lot about life, relationships, myself, fuck what didn't i learn?  because of my relationship with sally my next relationship is bound to be  fucking amazing  - because of what i learned in this one.

      so after much partying this weekend - i think i got it all out of my system.  this weekend was probably the best weekend i've had since all the drama - only because i didn't really think about it other than recieving a bunch of mail with her name on it - so it just... was an overall smooth weekend.    today is sunday, fathers day.  i'm not going to go over to my parents and celebrate fathers day today though ... i think i'm going to celebrate... ""SONday"" because in reality thats all today really is right?  haha.  anywho so i can't say i'm really 'enjoying' the single life - i miss every bit of my old life... but for the circumstances that i'm faced with i guess i'm making the best of it.  it sucks that sally and i can't even have a simple talk about anything - and neither one of us really know anything about what each other is up to do or doing... so i mean its hard.    i talked to a few girls this weekend which i suppose is progress, but i talked about all the drama which i'm sure was not too impressive... i'm still standing strong on the whole being single thing until june next year.. who knows how that will end up - but fuck at least i got a goal?  i still sit and hope sometimes that when my phone rings its her... and we're going to be able to have a civil conversation and do some catching up.. but those hopes fade away quickly when i see the reality of who is calling.  i wont deny it.  i miss her.    ahhh here is some cool shit - i went to JD's piano bar the other day and they called me up on stage as i was up there having a song sung to me... this girl was right at the stage sitting behind the bar that seperates the stage from the chairs... she was standing up... little cute mexican girl... so i picked her up.. over the bar.. and brought her on stage with me... 10 minutes later... she was gone :(  i thought that was kind of funny.  *sigh* so tonight i'm staying home... gonna do some cleaning up... tomorrow ... work :(.... and then gym... then.. we're having a small get together at our place for like a ... house warming gig... so.. i'm out like a gangstah in the night....  - dont hate  secret note:  hazards 3 times / all the way down the road.

      i guess i should pay my web hosting bill so that i can continue this wonderful, exciting, humanizing journal.  until i do i think i'll still make a quick post.  i never imagined that becoming single would cause my life to become more exciting.  for the last five nights in a row i have been out and have met so many awesome people its.. a bit over whelming.  i wouldn't trade being able to go to different places, and seeing different people, and meeting different people, and forming my own group of friends for anything.  it truely is as if my life is begining to venture out on its own - last night i got my first .... phone call that was like... ""hey come party""... so of course last night i partied.  *sigh*  june 5th 2005 still going strong...   wed night was crazy.  i went to jd's in pontiac which is this little dope piano bar... it was a pretty laid back atmosphere until i had 13 beers in my system and they were about to close - and the guys on the piano started playing loose yourself by eminem... yea things got a little crazy.  *sigh* so after the bar let out.. i ventured to find my car - which was no where to be found... we did find it the next day though after i had to call some girl to give me a ride back home because we had no ride.  i got home and... PASSED RIGHT OUT. it was over.  tonight we're going to some big party @ eastern for a few hours then ending the night in ann arbor for UofM party.  *sigh* all of this partying.... but hey i'm meeting lots of new people.. doing lots of new things...  okay.. bye :)

      tonight was the first night i have actually went out and had a good time without thinking of all of the drama that has been surrounding my life lately.  my buddy mike and i started our night out by going and seeing ""the day after.."" the movie was ... alright.  we followed up the movie by hitting up peppi's sports bar and had a few drinks, he sang a few songs, i rejected a few chicks - and then we continued on with our wonderful night.    i didn't realize until the way home.. that i didn't think about all of this bullshit once tonight.  now that is progress.  let me tell you.  so i'm sitting here drunk and ... fixing to goto bed because it is an early morning i have to go to work and do the responsible thing... ya know?  (some people have to work for what they want / have) and for those that don't ... yes i'm jealous... but at the same time i also have something that you guys lack.. its called pride.  something you will swear you have for the things that are given to you..which you probably do have a bit of pride in the things that are handed too you - 5 years down the line compare your feeling now to the feeling you will have when you get something on your own ;).  Yes that was a stab at some people.  anywho...  So last night Mike and I went to a get together @ his frat buddies house - watched the pistons game which was just unfuckingbelievable... shortly after the pistons game we decided that we were in the mood to celebrate so we went to tonic and got drunk! drank, danced... chatted a bit... it was an overall pretty good fucking night.  okay.. so .. i'm out like the drunk guy i am... work in the morning. :(   -goodnight :)

      this morning i woke up to my mom coming in my room @ 8 am telling me ""sally is on the phone for you"".  i was a bit excited, a bit scared, a bit ... excited.  when i got on the phone we talked for a minute and i found out that she had woke up late for her ACT's - and did not know what to do - so without coaxing her too much i persuaded her to come over to my parents which she did - horrible mistake.  after about an hour or so.. we bullshitted a bit / i pissed her off / and she left.  we then decided through phone conversation and online conversation that we just needed to stick to our original plan (read last post).  so there i am just trying to do what i have too to please her and make her happy... and then...  i get a text message on my phone that says ""what u doin?"" - I respond to her and let her know what i'm doing and she is just totally pissed off thinking i'm doing something else - which i can understand only because my AIM away message said ""out with mike"" and i'm telling her i'm at my sisters dance recital.. anywho... so we fight fight and fight... then when i get home from the dance recital... i have an IM on my screen.   sally (5:34:12 PM): out w/ mike? going on a cruise? i was going to tell you something, but i'm not anymore...nothing matters...sorry for IMing you.... my parents are here now, along w/ steph....i'll talk to you when i talk to you....  buh-bye...have fun tonight....i will too, don't worry. later.  Auto-response from ClownSteve (5:34:12 PM): ... out with mike ....   so i'm not sure what the fuck....to do.  *sigh*.  anyways... so i tried to call her after i got that message to see what it was that caused her to unblock me, then message me, then get pissed off and rub in my face that she was going out too and she was going to have fun... i honestly don't get it. senseless drama.  why couldn't she just call me if she had something ot say?  i don't get it.  anyways so we had our last communication... and now i'm off to cresent lake inn... i'm going to the bar for the first time in a year too try and ... ""have fun tonight"".  the only down fall to all of this is that i'm having to go with someone that dont like bars (my brother)... so its probably not going to be all that fun but fuck.. who knows...  1 year no sex, no girls.  thats my plan.  anyways so thats my post about today... life almost started to feel like it was kicking me in the ribs again... i had to look in the mirror and tell myself i'm sick of it.  *gets back up with confidence*   -goodnight

      i'm begining to realize.. i don't need her. *sigh* i never thought i would say that but i'm saying it.  each time we talk on the phone there is this feeling, or lack there of that haunts me - its this feeling of unhappiness.  i'm not sure why i'm devoting so much effort into something that should be so natural.  i'm begining to think that sally is more of a convience than anything.  i'm trying to force love, love that isn't there anymore.  *sigh*   i'm begining to see all this..  i know that its possible for me to be happy with out her in my life, that is something that i've never realized before - but i'm realizing it now.  she has been gone a week, and although i have spent that week alone in my apartment, i've spent this week reflecting on how 'alone' really feels.  although i look forward to her phone calls, and hearing about her escapades - it does not excite me that i will be seeing her friday.  it scares me more than anything.  we are so up and down.  i just don't think there is love anymore - on either side.    its about that time where her and i are going to go our seperate ways, i feel it.. and for the first time i'm not going to fight it or object to it.  i'm ready to walk down the new street to see what life has to offer me.. i mean if its meant to be it will happen right?  we both just need time to find happiness within ourselves again, and in that time we may find other people, we may not, but one thing is for certain - we would be much happier down the road if we were to ever get back together, than we would be if we continue ... ""this"".    this sucks.. i hate it... but when i've come to these conclusions.. something is wrong.  i've lost hope.  whos knows.. we'll see how things go... its Wednesday morning...see how many more days her and i are able to stand each other... i predict 4.  -goodnight

      *sigh* its not possible for me to describe the confusion that i'm going through right now.  i just wish that we could go back to being happy, living with one another.  although that is just a wish / want / hope / its impossible; yet nothings impossible? bullshit.  so here we go another attempt at being 'together' - with the entire world against us something that in the past we have failed miserably at.  the only way we could possibly win this battle was to ""have nothing to loose"" which isn't the case.  sally has everything in the world too loose in this battle.  *sigh*.  the only thing i have to loose is her, yet she is my everything.  i'm so fucking stuck..  enough with that shit.  i sat around today waited for her phone call, took capone for many walks - he definitely got his work out on today.  as i type this he is passed out in his cage - tired as fuck.  sally called sometime tonight too let me know she made it safe to Vancouver, that was cool...i guess she is coming home this friday... i'm pretty stoked... hopefully nothing happens before then.. i'm not planning on friday.. i started taking her and i day by day... that way if something happens between her and i.. the hopes / dreams / plans that are lost with her... aren't there too hurt.    i can't wait until i have happy / positive things to post about... i really wish i could write... ""we're living together again"" ... but somethings.... are just...  fucking impossible.  -goodnight

      its been along time since i've had to question the status of sally and i.  the last few weeks, almost a month now it almost seems as if it is a constant habit having to question this.  the day before she left for vacation (saturday) we met... and there was ""i love yous"" there was.. hugs and most importantly there was some kisses.  now.. we mock the whole idea behind being ""friends"" because at the end of the day technically that  is  all we are.    the night before she left though - she told me that she thought that our friendship 'was moving too fast' and if we continue the way we were going that i would never change.  so i simply agreed with her and continued to tell her that i was happy with her JUST in my life, and was not going to be picky about however that may be.  yet on the phone with her before we let each other go.. i did tell her i loved her once again, not because i was looking for it to come back out of her mouth - but only because i knew she was traveling the next day... and when i feel like telling her, ""hey i love you"" before we get off the phone... i'm going to do it - i mean if something were to ever have happened to her on this vacation... i would hold a lot of regret in my heart for not saying it soley because we are 'friends'.  friend or no friend - guess what - i love her. =*|  so now she is on vacation - and i'm stuck here not having the slightest clue what her and i are...she said this morning when i repeated to her ""we're just friends.."" she said is that why we were saying i love you, yesterday?? so dude i'm fucking confused, yet again... and i'm not quite sure what to do with it... its 11:30 pm here... 8:30 pm there and i haven't heard from her all day.  so i'm stuck... confused... mad... confused?   WILL SOMETHING JUST HAPPEN ALREADY!!!!  OKAY.  -goodnight

      so the pistons take on the lakers this sunday for the nba championship, this should be some what interesting.  right?  = today was kind of boring, basicly did a whole lot of nothing.  after my morning fiascos i came home for a few minutes then shot straight back up north to see sally... heh 50 miles one day and recently i'm finding myself doing that trip....twice.. three times a day... wow.. gas =\  anyways... we met up at mcdonalds and from there basically we just went too best buy.. left there and.... thats about it =\  (would like to give more details but have to respect her right of privacy)  on my way home from there i got really pissed off at the thought of driving another 50 miles back to an empty apartment, i mean i spend the majority of my time here alone - and its just to a point now that i can't stand it ... and the thought really puts anger in me.  (heh as i'm typing this capone just went in his cage and went to sleep).  so today i decided i was going to try and get a hold of my buddy that just got out of the army like last sunday... and i hadn't seen him - so i did / he came back down to my apartment with me and we did a lot of catching up.... none the less that was boring too :(  so i drove another 50 miles back up north to drop him off back at home (he decided to tell me he had a car on our way back).  heh its so funny / i realize that my days are so boring .... its my thoughts... my emotions... and basically how i think that seems to be so compelling... yet i find it hard ... to actually write about those in a public enviroment such as this.  *sigh*.  heh okay.  -goodnight

      just a quick note.  i never intended for this to be a ""daily"" journal - it just turned out that way.  Having this journal is a unique experience, it gives me a place i can come too and vent and allow people to vent with me, agree, disagree, offer advice, opinions but it also gives me the ability to remain private.  although i seldomly keep a post from being published, when i do i usually have reasons why.  the last two days ... and possibly some days too come.. if you notice a lack of posting and updates, this isn't because i'm loosing my motivation too post, its me just keeping some of my days private.. i post every single night... before i close my eyes. whether or not i choose to share them... is my discretion.  so i'm still alive... the last two days have been hell.  tonight turned out better than i originally expected it too... but then again... i'm not sure i go into my days with any expectations anymore...except... my dog to listen?    heh... thats my post for the night :)  -goodnight

      today was hell. in the wake of our Wednesday night just when things started to feel normal again - with the lack of sleep .... and the over whelming frustration of the 'changes' happening between her and i... things went to shit.  we fought / went to bed / woke up and here we are again.... ""ended"".  i begged and pleaded all day and just when i was finished doing so... there you are ready to hang out and squash the entire episode... like this is a fucking game.  you heard me earlier on the phone.. ya know?  you know how upset all of this is making me... you know what you are capable of doing to me... yet one thing was different this evening... ALL day and early night you fucking treated me like total shit, and acted as though what i was going through didn't matter too you and you gave two shits about how i felt only about what you wanted, and about what you felt... you hardly gave me the time of the day other than answering your phone... yet one thing i did notice tonight that will help me out in the future...  the moment i came to reality... that there was nothing i could do, and i am so sick and tired of one day bonnie and clyde against the world / next day bonnie and clyde shooting each other.... that i calmed down and acted like the shit didn't phase me.  the minute you called and heard that i was calmed down and i wasn't ""emotional"" about it anymore... then we were able to fucking squash the stupid bullshit and hang out and actually treat one another like humans... wait on that note... when don't you get treated like a human... i believe that if i talked to you the way you talk to me everytime you get mad... just talked to you ONCE like you talk to me all the time when your mad... you would leave... but i dont.. i stick around... and ya know.. i cant blame a single soul but myself when this hits rock bottom... because i see what your doing... i see what your capable of doing to me... and yet i stand around and take it ... because i have one thing that no matter what... WONT go away....  hope.

      today we met up around 4... and it turned out to be a fruit bowl of emotions from the very begining.  a major part of me was happy to see you, and feels completed when your around - it just feels ""right"".  then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again.    in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.  but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.  although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the CVS to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, ""i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you"".  the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.  it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.  when i'm not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i've been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.  so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i'm not in her life - which i'm sure doesn't take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void.    as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i'm living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i ""lived in michigan"" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.  then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.  be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.  this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally.    this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn't do... but i do.  so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.  its sad really.  so i'm not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i'm going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.  we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we're able to survive this.  *sigh*

      i think the poem actually speaks for itself - so there is nothing i can really add.  except, comment of course.   windows are down as the cool breeze goes by the music is on low so i can hear myself drive  i watch the lines in the road as they go by slow i hear the raine hitting my tires as if it were snow  i can smell the humidity flowing in the air my face is getting wet and i just dont care  every few seconds i watch my windshield get wiped its just at that moment i realize how alone i am tonight  i pull over in a empty lot with really bright lights i get my pen and pad cease the moment and start to write  i begin to observe all which i can see i begin to realize no one else is around but me  i ask myself questions hoping my heart will be honest i ask myself if im able to not be with her this august  its her birthday in 11 days and she is so far away how did all of this happen why wont we share that day  things im pondering inside my mind sitting in the car on august 10th instead of being with her ill go to the bar  not to drink away my pain and sorrow but to celebrate my life and the new tomorrow  1 year ago we were together in texas the farthest thing from our heads was that we would ever be ex's  part of me of course wishes that all of this was a dream but then again if it was i would have never found me  a guy that can sit in a empty lot writing his thoughts a guy that never use to give up on life but always fought  a guy that believed in himself every step of the way a guy that struggles for his future but still knows how to play  a guy that is secure enough to write how he feels a guy that is strong enough to stand up for his ideals  i realize that no matter what is going on with my mind im so happy in life right now why even look behind  life is music and you just have to learn how to dance i think i've learned enough now, i'll give love another chance  here i am sitting alone in this lot with not a bit of fear if i could be anywhere else in the world i'd still be right here.

      its 5:30 pm and the invites to places have already began to pour in for tonight. yet i'm still so fucking clueless as to what i'm going to do - what should i do?  this is the question i'm left pondering.  although i'm totally not in the mood to sit at home tonight i'm also really not in the mood to be in the ""club"" atmosphere.  i do have some options though lets see this is what has presented itself to me this afternoon.  1) Canada with like 12 people 2) Saginaw street 3) I'm making this one up right now - The Movies  i suppose the movies would be the best choice because i mean thats more along the lines of what im in the mood to do, now the question is, who the fuck do i go to the movies with?  everyone already seems to have plans.. i don't have a girl (nearby) that i can take, blah.  maybe it'll end up just a 'steve night' - yeah.. that sounds rather refreshing actually, i think i might just go by myself to the movies.  now if you guys wanna show up and watch the movie with me your more then welcome.  i think i'm gong to go see the villiage at the star theater by great lakes crossing probably between 9-10.  this is just about the only thing i can think of doing that appeals to me, BUT who knows feelings change, moods change, plans change and then... you get an updated journal entry and see the result of all my trying to plan attempts.  okay i'm going to eat a bologna sandwich.    peace.

       ""..help is on the way..""  is what they chanted as john kerry made promises and gave hope to all americans in his speech.  it was almost as if i was watching a classic wrestling match, the way the crowd interacted with him and said it in unison.   it's 4am and i've just finished watching the speech for the second time.  there were a few statements that he made that i just have to mention, so here i go :)   ""we don't go to war because we want too, we go to war because we have too""    ""And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.""     ""The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected Â it is a right for all Americans.""    very cool john:  ""I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.""    these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.  i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.  i'm looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before.    maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?  something i will consider :)  right now this is the place where i come to write, and right now, this minute... this is all i can think of writing about because it has consumed my day, and my thoughts.  for a full transcript of johns speech  urlLink click here .  2008 i'll be part of this:    -goodnight.

      so have you guys been paying any attention to the democratic national convention?  i'm sure you've seen bits and pieces on the news - since this is my journal and not political oriented i'm not going to rant and rave about the convention, or my views, nothing like that.  i'm going to simply post an over view of trends i'm noticing.  one thing interesting about this election, is that ""blogging"" is actually becoming a voice on the web.  at this years DNC there is a whole slew of ""bloggers"" that were invited to come and document the convention, as part of the press.  that is amazing.  here is a picture of them setup at the convention.  this is something new that has never been done before, its as if we (bloggers) are begining to have an impact just as powerful is that of a journalist that types their opinion in the columns of worlds most powerful newspapers.  this is moving.    although my blog is more of a personal blog than a political blog, those of you that know me, know that i am very passionate about my beliefs and feelings on politics.  so i've added some links to the right hand side, that i'm reading every day to keep in touch with whats going on at the DNC, that we don't see come through the tube.  also i was able to find a good article full of links and information about "" urlLink blogging from boston "".    so is everyone excited for a new president?  prepare. :)

      i've needed to get away for a minute, and just have not had the oppertunity with work and everything.  so this weekend i ended up going 4 1/2 hours north west to the other side of michigan to go camping for a day with my family.  i was apprehensive at first only because, i generally don't like hanging out with my family - but it ended up being a blast, the family got along great - everyone was laughing, in fact i had such an amazing time that when it came time to leave there tonight - i hesitated cause i was having so much fun. wierd eh?  so anyways sunday morning i went and picked chad up, and we drove out there together - it was a good road trip there was a lot of scenic shit.  none the less we got up there and found the camp ground (after using the fucking sun to navigate cause mapquest was WRONG!)  so we get up there my parents are not even @ their campsite so ... we go driving around this town to the sand dunes and look for them and low and behold we find them!! what are the chances, anyways sooooooo we ended up going out to the sand dunes in my dads truck... sunday night and having a complete blast out there, driving up these steep fucking hills and back down them... it was ... something you would have to experince my words won't actually tell you anything... but you'll be able to tell from the pictures what i'm talking about.  i watched my second sunset in my entire life!! (check out the pics) the first time i seen one was when i was visiting out in san francisco (sun sets right there), and the second one was here... the only thing that was missing... was while i was sitting there watching it... i was IN ANOTHER WORLD wishing someone else was there sitting next to me, buttttttttttt yeah actually... that was the entire trip i wished she was there...   i didn't even see this picture until i got home and downloaded the pics, someone must have took it while i was there day dreaming...   we got back to the campsite and sat around the fire telling jokes and what not, it was quite wierd - for the first time in ... my entire life i felt like ... we were a family. then i realized lyndsey wasn't there, but it still felt good. i miss her.  anyways it was odd.  i woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and we went RIGHT back out to the sand dunes where we seen a car flip (no one was hurt) and .. we got some more amazing photos of these guys on dirt bikes... flying through the air... all around it was goooood fucking times... my first family vacation i can actually say i enjoyed (even though i did only last a day)... i enjoyed it.  would have enjoyed it more if you were there though..  so thats my post... hope you guys enjoy the pictures... here i'll make it easy here is a link   urlLink click on sand dunes   sooooo thats my weekend, i wish i had more interesting things to say but i dont.  so... goodnight... and farewell!!  comment on pics  -peace  *ps* - i read  your  comment - thanks for the good luck wishes.

      today was very uncomplicated.  around 7ish mike and i went to tiki bobs for nicks free party pass thing, we were able to drink for free until nine.. and we took advantage of that.  while i was there i ran into some old high school buddies which was fucking amazing cause i have anot seen them fucks in almost 5 or 6 years... so that was awesome.. we left tiki bobs and headed to rochester to the main street grill, where we all played each other in some pool.  we did have plans that followed main street, and that was to go see a movie, but that all changed when drinks got in us - we decided to roll back over to nicks house and play presidents and assholes... a drinking game, so we picked up a case on the way from cvs andddddd drank our asses off for a little while - i know i got fucked up pretty bad at one point, i had to lay my head on the couch and shut my eyes for a bit - but then i woke up, sobered up, drove home and most importantly made it home safe... its 3:21 am so i did good.  side note:  DONT DRINK AND DRIVE - ONLY FUCKING IDIOTS DO THAT SHIT!!!   one day i will practice what i preach until then think of my is king hypocrite, think of me however the fuck you want to think of me.. but i know a few of you guys that read this ... drink and are not even old enough to drink so.. let it me known... if you need a ride... call me see if i'm sober.. if i'm not... i'll pay for a taxi.. alright?  beat your fucking asses you drive drunk... lyndsey..kelly... dana....jessica..  okay so that is my night... i think i'm going to go to sleep now... so goodnight.

      well yesterday was kellys birthday - she was totally not looking forward to it, i happened to read her journal and just felt bad for her, so i made sure i was the first one to wish her a happy birthday :P .  apparently she got a expensive digital cam for her birthday, can't be mad at that kel :P  anyways hope you had a happy birthday - you were in my thoughts :)  i'm not sure what is going on with my dad.  after all the drama i wake up to emails from him inviting me to go camping with him this weekend - i was a bit shocked.  i ended up calling him, and found out chad (my brother) was going to be over there, so i shot over there and hung out for awhile.  ending up laying in the pool for a little while then i had to take off.  it was relaxing just to be in a pool, its been awhile - haha i love to swim so much.  this past winter my old sidekick and i ran up in hotels and used them for their pool, and then we would bounce and go home.  it was gangster.  anyways so yeah it was nice to fucking lay out in the pool.    left there came home and just got really lazy and bored.  it was.. disgusting really.  at some point i think around 10:30 i decided to go out and went over to tonic for a little while, had a few drinks, danced, but the most interesting part of the whole entire night i would have to say was....  i was up at the bar just kind of observing the dance floor, when i noticed this black man walk by me - wearing this necklace that was blinding, straight bling.  as i looked up at his face, it was almost as if recognizing a child hood friend - obie trice was a hand length away from me... as i looked at him he looked at me.. i kind of grinned like.. i know who you are none of these fuckers do.. i was like whats up man.. anyways we ended up talking for about 10 minutes - i told him his CD was one of the better CD's to come off the shady imprint since the eminem show, he smiled and said ""listen to this..."" and pulled a cd out of his pocket - it is just a burned CD straight out of the lab, bad ass song - produced my eminem.  he ended the conversation by saying, ""alright man i have to get up there.."" (V.I.P) - it was dope.. but the dopest part after he walked away from me, he came back like 5 seconds later and was like whats your name again... who knows small world whatever.. he dont remember it now..  sooo i'm home now... been home for awhile... waiting for lynn to get online because i really wanna talk to her... she is on the phone right now :(  so thats just about where my night stands right now... i'm watching the dave chappelle show - erika badu or however you spell her name is doing a performance... alright well.. i'm out like a thief in the night :)  -night. ps. let me know what you guys think of the new look. :)

      i breathe in and blow it back out watch the smoke come floating out of my mouth.  i lean my head back and close my eyes and rest my body on the couch.  i begin to have thoughts of how i survived how im still here how im alive.  i dont know when it happened or how but its then i really begin to realize.  i dont feel the pain i dont think of you in vain to me your just a memory just a name.  i dont feel abandoned or left alone to rot i dont wish you were here im glad that your not.  i miss what we had but not all of the bad and i wouldnt take you back cause it would all come back.  i will search out another treasure that does not ever bring pain but only pleasure.     i pick up my head from leaning back on the couch i open my eyes and i know what all this is about.  i put out my cigerette with ease of mind, finally feel relaxed for the first fucking time.  i just realized where i am, im alone and surviving its proof that i can.  i felt the need to write what i realized tonight i know its a little sappy but thats alright  i couldn't help but share with everyone...  im finally fucking happy .

      why am i up?  its 3:30 in the fucking morning there is no need for me to be up.  nothing entertaining is going on, there is no one to talk to online, and most importantly, i have a lot of things that i need to accomplish tomorrow.  why am i still up?  who the fuck knows.  the more i think about it, the more i fear i'll never get tired, so here i am - in an attempt to do something which ordinarily relaxes me :)  the stuff party last night was pretty dope.  by now the majority of you guys have seen the pictures, so you know it was looking like a good time.  to answer all of your questions at once, the band that was playing was darren mcarty's band (he is a defenseman for the detroit redwings) - they were alright.  the best part of the entire night was the fact that i got fucked up - i hardly drank a drop, but when it came to smoking - i smoked.  it was ... wonderful :)  i danced the majority of the night after the band got done playing - as a matter of fact i could not find it in me to stop dancing, i just danced... and danced... and danced.  came home, posted real quick, and crashed.  today was fun. mike and i went to the rec center and practiced dodge ball, well that was the plan but seeings a lot of people did not show up we substituted our game for a quick run of the gym hitting the weights, and then for a quick game of one on one basketball.  so regardless we got our workout on.  we ended our wonderful day at arbys where we picked up dinner.  the minute i got home i showered because i was EXTREMELY hot.  that was fucking amazing - orgasmic really.  so now i'm up and i can't sleep.  but now i've posted, so maybe i'm relaxed enough to try again.  alright here i go ... 1... 2... 3...  latah.  ps.  i couldn't be happier with life right now :)

      today was busy.  i'm not use to busy days :)  it was nice.  mike and i took the girls back to baycity.. we stopped for lunch on the way home at A & W i didn't realize how good their fucking food was - i was diggin that place.  anyways i started the drive... and with the lack of sleep and the honestly not really paying attention... about 25 minutes into the trip... mike says, ""dude we're going north.."" so yeah.  i wasted alot of time driving in the completely opposite direction of home, so i pulled over and was like ""your driving"".  so i got the chill for a few hours on the ride home - it was relaxing although i didn't get to sleep as i had planned i was to caught up in the music... that happens sometimes.     after we got back home we chilled for a few minutes, and went directly to my dads house to go pick up all of my shit that he was storing for me - that was fun.  he is such a fucking idiot - he emails me and plays this hardass, that doesn't give a fuck about his kids, implies he pretty much hates us, and then when i show up expecting the worst he is going to act like he is my best friend.  what the fuck.  i said maybe two words to him, for the first 20 minutes while we packed up the back of mikes truck - and then all of the sudden i think he kind of detected that there was some tension coming his way from me - and he out of know where offered me to use his van with the trailer so i only had to make one trip... awww how nice of you pops, its the least you could fucking do.  i'm not going to complain, it made things a hell of a lot easier on time.   so i got to mikes and just threw all of my shit in the garage where i'm going to store it for now... i think i'll break into it tomorrow or something.. i don't know.  its going to be nice to have my desktop back though.      anyways.  so i left back towards my parents house to return the van and i heard a song... and the fucking song just fucked with me, i've heard it so many fucking times in the past but i've never listened to it - this time i listened to it ... and it fits... i dedicate to my parents (staind - for you).  got back with the van and my dad had company over, so as i went to go give him the keys and let him know i was leaving he became dad of the year and offered me dinner.  i was fucking shocked.  (no matter how much i hate you i can't turn down free food.)  so i ate.  then he said, ""why don't you party with us tonight..."" i almost started having seizures.  i think it is so funny that he thinks he can pop in my life and out of my life playing the dad role when its convient for him.  when no one is around and he is just miserable, he don't like me, or us for that matter.  but god damnit if his friends are around he is a ""cool dad"".  fuck you.  i hate you.        your a piece of shit of an excuse for a dad and i regret every single day of giving you another chance to be there and be a dad  ... i should have went with my fucking mom to florida.    i fucking hate him  .  but he don't think anything is wrong with him, he thinks everybody else is wrong.  lets look at the facts.      i moved out when i was 16  chad moved out when he was 17  lyndsey just moved out (she just turned 17)  kristyn left the day she turned 18   wow, i notice a fucking pattern.  blah.  i fucking hate him.  anyways so that was my night... well there was more but i can't talk about it cause it just don't involve me and it wouldn't be very nice of me to divulge other peoples business... ya know?  so yeah.  hope you enjoyed my post... its the first one in awhile that i'm venting in.  i'm pissed, i can vent right?  i can't be cool all the time.. shit gets exhausting ha.... alright enjoy ya'lls weekend :)

      so yesterday was interesting to say the least.  mike and i met up with a girl and her friend (fahlon & krystal) up in baycity - which by the way was a long fucking drive.  so we went and picked the girls up, on the way home we stopped at burger king - which was kinda fun because they were wearing some skirts that were... lets just say 'short', and well it was windy outside :).      we got back to the house and just started to get fucked up.  i'm not sure why, i'm not sure how, i'm not sure even... when... but i know right after we arrived here we started drinking.. and then we ended up out in the garage smoking... eventually we ended up @ tonic night club dancing and drinking.  it was a pretty dope night - up until bed time, but thats another story in itself.     i'm sitting on the floor right now because i had to be the gentlemen and let them sleep in my bed, and well i've been awake laying on the floor since 3 am with no sleep - finally i decided i was going to call it quits and just stay up today because it would be pointless for me to even sleep, i still have to drive them home.     i'm not looking forward to today at all.  as soon as i drop them off back in baycity i have to go to my dads house and pick up all my crap from the old place and bring it over here - something i'm not looking forward too, nor do i want to do.  if the majority of the shit over there wasn't so fuckign expensive i wouldn't think twice about leaving it over there.  here is what i had in my inbox this moring :)         -----Original Message-----    F  rom: Stephen Parent [mailto:tool*****@hotmail.com]    Sent: Friday, July 16, 2004 3:55 AM    To: Steve Parent Jr    Subject: NOW  Stevie,       Come get your shit today or it will be moved to the purple heart or red cross I am not kidding.      god do i love my fucking father.  :)  this should be fun - i'm sure i'll have a lot of wonderful things to post about tonight!! blah fuck you pops!!     so i think i'm going to let them sleep for another hour, then wake their asses up so i can get my day started - they are some cool ass chicks to kick it with... we will probably do it again in the future.... so yeah thats my post.     oh yeah - new pictures :)     - good morning

      ok, can i just talk about gw bush the 'good ole boy'?  i mean, come on...  gw bush went to andover. and yale. he's from greenwich, connecticut.  he vacations in maine.  and don't get me wrong, andover, yale, greenwich, and maine are all lovely places.  but they're not exactly breeding grounds for 'good ole boys' who drive rusty pickup trucks and herd cattle(gw bush most likely grew up stealing golf carts and occasionally riding polo ponies, both of which are fine adolescent, preppy pursuits, but are not the sort of pursuits that people associate with good ole boys from deep in the heart of texas).  it just galls me when gw goes out and plays cowboy and some of the voters actually believe that he's a man of the people.  gw bush exists to serve his billionaire masters, and that's it.  so the next time you see gw pretending to be a good ole boy or a man of the people just remember that he grew up summering in good ole greenwich connecticut getting drunk on golf courses and bragging about his rich daddy.  if gw bush is a cowboy from texas then i'm a weight-lifter from siberia.   just seen him on the news and got annoyed.   -goodnight

      for the first time in forever i forgot my phone in my car.  this is normal, as i'm sure that many of you reading this have done this as well.  it is abnormal for me though - ever since the bullshit... my phone is plugged in and charges in the same room as i am while i'm sleeping... well last night i forgot it in my car.  which i suppose shows progress... i mean before i'd get dressed up to go back outside and grab it before i goto bed... but last night, not a thought in my head about it.    so if that is any type of measure of my progress i suppose its a good steady incline of my overall progress, right?   there were a few 'firsts' for everything today.  when i woke up the first thing i did was LOOK for my phone, which was as i said - out in my car.  so i grabbed a cigerette and walked outside - go to my phone.. and someone called me @ 5 am... private name.  i have a very  strong  feeling who it was...and that to me is irony.  the first time i leave my phone in the car, she decides to call.. if that isn't a sign.  anyways.. i hope everything is fine with you, and everything is okay.  i remember what the '5 a.m.' phone calls are about.. and i hope your night was alright, drama free.  sorry i didn't pick up.  none the less...   there is nothing else to post.  -goodnight

      ""honesty"" it is something that i'm learning.  for in the past i would have been 'afraid' of sarah's reaction to ""the truth"" - but now i speak of nothing but, and the reaction is... at first is understanding and support - but the long term reaction is her disappearing out of my life.  do i regret telling her the truth? not at all.  you see truth is always the best policy and the reward is often so much more than you expect.  yes it sucks that she does not want to see me or hang out with me because it sucks for her, but at least she knows that i was real with her - and we aren't ending for any ""odd"" reason for which she couldn't understand or comprehend.. we are ending because everything was put out in the open with my feelings - and it is simple to understand.  i miss her though *shrugs* but its best.  i think that was just considered, 'rambling' was it not?    anyways.  so today was pretty lame. (as i'm typing this capone is laying on the bed with me ... making funny noises looking at me wanting to go to sleep - fuck i love him).  i stayed home most of the day... OH WAIT.  at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.  capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.     so back to my day.  i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.  got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly's apartment and watched ""ghost ship"" that is an alright flick.  not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.  one of those things.    i'm feeling better about everything.  i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the 'cloud' that over shadowed sarah and i's friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.  your thinking, ""what cloud?"" - well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?  we have all been there.  so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.  i wasn't ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.  so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.   i'm going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.   -goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy!

      last night i went to lush barroom again.  that was kind of cool.  afterwards i went to kellys apartment and attempted to watch fight club. left there came home let capone outside, where he got bit by ants so i had to give him a bath at 6 am. fun? no.  then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn't end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.  sucked.    today i'm going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the 'techofest' which should be a blast, i'm excited for it anyways.  we'll see how that goes.  bye.   does he kiss you and give you butterflys? do you see your future when you look in his eyes? when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man? when you lay down does he play with your hair? when ever hes gone are wishing he was there? when you fuck each other do you think of me? do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve? when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides? does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares? when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far? would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you? would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true? do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look? does he know what gets you going like he has read your book? when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face? when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place? do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me? do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve? do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream? do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back? do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you? do you ever wonder if i'm still in love? do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs? do you ever wonder if im fucking? do you even care who i'm hugging?  does he kiss you and give you butterflies? or is it just a coverup of how you really feel inside?  it is for me.

      its 10:17 pm and i'm sitting here with capone.  lots of invites out tonight but i really felt the need to just relax tonight - my body feels so exhausted.  which is odd.  i eat better now than i have in the past year.  yesterday for example sarah grilled me some ribs, the day before that she grilled me some chicken cabobs, the day before that she grilled me some steak.  as i write this i'm wiping away juice from a fruit cocktail i just made after an extreme grocery purchase at meijers.  i often think to myself, sally would be happy to see how i'm living now opposed to how i was while we were together - but then i think to myself i wouldn't be living this way if she was here - i'd be too focused on other things.   so i'm not doing anything tonight - at all.  no sarah, no club, no bar, no drinking, no nothing.  me and my homie capone... chillin.. about to turn on the tv and see whats on.. probably fall into a deeeeep sleep.  blah. im not in a good mood.  -blah fucking blah.. goodnight.

       mike, sarah, and i went to this club tonight.  it was the awesome!!  we ended up first of all walking in, not having to stand in a line - then i met the two girls that run the production company who hosted the party... and they gave us free drinks all night - i think between the three of us we bought... 1 drink.  we all got drunk very very very very cheap.  great music, great people, great atmosphere.. it was just as dope as it could be.  actually tonight was amazing.  i wish i would have taken my camera into the club so you could see pictures of mike breaking it down - hahaha i even got into the action.. we were having such a blast.  i danced with dana, it made sarah act a little wierd - that lasted for about 20 seconds i think when she realized i didn't really care what she thought - because i'm not going to be all up on her.. or any female for that matter ever again.  i'm gonna have fun and do what i want... because thats how its suppose to be.  so she didn't say anything to me and chilled out - and we ended up having a really goodnight.  we left there, dropped off sarah... and mike and i hit up the taco bell in waterford.  lol drunk and eating..it was such a good idea.  sarah? yes here is a picture sarah  so this is sarah.. she is dope.. very sweet.. very kind... and she is  very  independent. :)  anyways.. thats my day / night... and.. now i'm out like a gangster in a cop movie.. peaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!  oh wait. thought i would mention.... stuff magazine party.. detroit... july 17th... catch me in the august issue... i will be sittin V.I.P with mikey and the family... hahaha I'M PSYCHED!!!  -peace

      today was kind of fun.  mike and i went to the 'village square' which is a mall based outside.  very neat.  it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the A/C.  *sigh*.  capone got some training today.  he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.  neat eh?  i guess the 'training' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.  he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.  i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.  after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah's house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.  we then proceeded to go to nick's house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.  came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).  i'm beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.  i feel like i'm slowing down time.. or i'm speeding up with it, and i'm beginning to catch up with everything about me.  is there still some things i want to change? of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute. (blah i'm rambling).  what i'm really trying to say is... i'm becoming more focused ... i'm becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.  today on the way home from sarah's house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.  wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.  now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i've had to deal with, but i wasn't as wise then - in fact i was nieve.  through this i've become more wise, and less nieve.  i will never gamble ""myself"" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.  never again.  so i'm becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.  i've become more wise.. and since you can't learn wisdom, and you can't teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i'm growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose.    -goodnight.  ps. new picture of capone... more on my pictures page.

      well lets see. last night i spent the night with sarah again and we had long exhausting sex until the sun came up, it was outstanding.  actually i'm kidding but thats what people seem to assume when you mention staying the night with someone, well another sex i suppose.  with all the partying going on neither one of us were really in the mood to do much of anything, so we decided that we would just chill out - so we went to her house and grilled out... chicken cabobs... haha they were dope.  ran up to the party store and bought a 12 pack.. and we just sat around and drank some beer and talked all night - it was very relaxing.. i was.. happy.     update:   today i TOTALLY RELAXED. it was wonderful.  at some point tonight i think around 12:30ish or so mike and i drove back out to waterford to meet kelly @ cvs and we smoked a bowl with her.... got some white castle after she finally found the one that she ""knew"".  yes that was wonderful.  that is all i did today it was a lot of fun actually.. i couldn't have enjoyed today more.    tomorrows to do list: - bank - car insurance - condo - sprint - work at some point - possibly if time take capone out to park  thats it...   - peace & goodnight

      this post will not be long tonight i don't think, but then again who the fuck knows.  my mood the last few days has been quite cynical.  which does not make sense since right this moment, i have more going for me in my life than i have in months.  i don't get it.  anyways i already posted about this but i made it private.  sorry i do keep somethings private, when i know its in my best interest.  sue me.  it is so hard for me to sit here and write, without venting.  i've written 3 lines and just erased them.    today was interesting.  i got the job i've wanted forever.  yes, caught you off guard did it not?  i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of 'doubt' with getting the job.  today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.  he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.  i'm fucking geeked.  i have to tell mah people now that i'm going to be leaving them, they will get over it.  so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.  i will post more later on that subject.    after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn't the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k? :)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.  after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.  we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.  because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.  it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.  maybe one day i'll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn't even wanna talk about it.  because it is so personal and deep.  oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the ""random"" folder.  i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i'm not going to tell you how.   i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i'd feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn't kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i'd be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.   that just came out as i was typing the post.  sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don't think you'll find a negetive one so i think i'm entitled to being 'down' once in awhile... this was my night.  dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.  comments are off on this one.   -goodnight

      today was interesting to say the least.  i felt like i needed ""alone time"" today.  i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.  it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.  it was peaceful.  on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.  so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.  went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.  i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn't trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.  so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.  tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i'm totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.  it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.  so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven't checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now.    ClownSteve: you get the pics downloaded? Kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass out   so i guess i'll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.  they are funny.  okay i'm in for the night.   -latah

      before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight   ""can you imagine if peter parker was high?""    ""steve this thing is so long and big""  (burrito at taco bell)   ""is this the CD?  no. then how are you starting it over? im not, its the radio.""  (Eminem - Stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.  so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some ""goods"" we went and smoked, in kelly's apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it'd be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can't write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.  it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.  the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.  who knows.  tonight was pretty intoxicating though.  i don't think i've laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.  in a real long time.  but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.  there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.  it was fun.  i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.  especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.  anyways so i'm home now its 3:42 am.  saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.  it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.  yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.  it was sad.  she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.  she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn't let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.  called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.  none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.  it takes a lot of stress away.  so we partied there that night for a little while.   haha i put saturday first.  friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.  i didn't end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.  so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.  the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.  2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.  well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.  oh well - couldn't change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.  it was fun.  then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.  i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo.    so that was my weekend.  and thats the end of my post.  -cheers.  (should have pictures of tonight tomorrow)

      Since I really have nothing else to post at this moment, I figured I would go ahead and acknowledge some of my favorite comments I've gotten.  I guess Dana leads the group...   I think ive read this like 5 times now.. and every time i read it i mean to leave a comment but I am either amazed or speechless at the end! I   You seem to have a lot of lady fans! Kepp it up lol    one of my favorites:  Your smarter than you act...    i liked this one a lot too:  ok i already told you this in IM but imma tell you again...this i think has to be my fav of yours. your stregnth amazes me...but you amaze me just about every day steve. you deserve to have a smile on your face at all times...and you deserve ALL the happiness in the world.   lynn   this was funny:  you & mike = PIMPS  the end.   lynn    this was touching:  Steve.. You are such an amazing person. You inspire me with your perseverance & strength. You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I've told you that since the day I met you. You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up. You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves. I've never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life. Your such a doll and I'm sorry for all that you've went through, I'm glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you. Your amazing.  Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :)    this one makes me smile when i read it:  w/e bitch! i knew where it was! lol u got ur sick ass white castle but those chicken things are kinda good- but maybe just cuz we smoked b4 that?      touching as well:  Steve,  You know you're like a big brother to me. It's scary because you've been more of a big brother to me than my own brother has. I never really tell you but you mean a lot to me. As you've seen before, I'm always going to be here for you. Even though you may do something that prevents us from talking for long periods of time, I'll always be here if you need me. I know you're confused about a lot of things that are going on in your life right now, but you know that things will eventually work out for the best. Sometimes things have to happen to make your life better. All you have to do is try not to think about the things that have gone wrong, and think about the things you've gained back since that thing went wrong. Example: Me. :D haha anyway. As I was saying, you're a great guy and you deserve a great girl. You seriously deserve nothing less than the best. I know that when you give your heart to a girl you give it 100%, and if that girl can't appreciate that..she doesn't deserve you. I've been here for you since you were in the army with nothing to do but get on the internet and chat in vzones. I've heard about many things that have gone on in your life. One thing I've noticed about you is that you always pull through and come out of it learning something that makes you a better person. Just know that it will get easier, and you will find a girl that will make you happy. Just give it time and try not to think about the bad things. I'm going to end this here because I think I'm getting too mushy. I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Love ya Steve, Alice    yea, this was original. worst comment so far:  hayy ur hott i have no idea who u r though i was on a website and then saw ur pic and i clicked on it so if u ever want to talk or somthin im me on xxblondebabe77xx    okay so those are the comments that I found that stood out.

      ""Being Twenty-Something""  They call it the ""Quarter-life Crisis."" It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.   You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.   You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.   Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.   You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.   One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap.  Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.   You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!   What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.  Send this to your twenty something friends.... maybe it will help someone feel like they aren't alone in their state of confusion.....    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US!!

       I can't help but think about the past. The past I truely want to forget. I just had my birthday a few days ago, and as I was talking to my friend about life in general, I realized that I am missing a major thing in my life. A man. What I mean is, I don't have a father, a boyfriend and or a close friend who is a guy. I used to. But my father passed away a few years ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of three years and me & my best guy friend  aren't as close as we used to be. Is there something wrong with that?

      I not might sure what's going on right now in my life. But what I'm sure about is that life is getting even more crazy as the day goes by. For example, last week, Jason's uncle called me. I bet your asking yourself, why is his uncle calling me right? Well, he called to tell me that he likes me! I know it sounds really strange but I thought he was joking or something but he wasn't. He also told me something that I would never get over. Jason has a two year old son and his married. The worst part is, Jason was married the past few years! I can't believe he would do that. I must be blind not to have noticed anything....

      So much for my happy ending  Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high  On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  It's nice to know you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  So much for my happy ending

       Entry originally posted on 8 August 2003 .  This is not a journal in the traditional sense of the word. This is an exploration, a new beginning mapped out through language and metaphor. There are a great many changes that are taking place in my life. Tommorrow, I will become a mother to a tuxedo cat named Demeter. In two weeks, I will be starting graduate school, embarking on a life-long journey into the world of academia. My friend, Julius has joined the Navy and will be shipped off to basic training next week. Lots of changes.  So, this space is a reflection of those changes, the need to write and think beyond the traditional weblog, livejournal, or daily journal. This space will be composed of ideas, broad themes, academic pursuits, and the occasional antedote about graduate school and life, in general.  There will not be an archive section, because the purpose of this space is to write and live in the present and not rehash the past nor to dwell on the future.   Right now, I am walking in darkness.

      ""For the love of God is broader that the measure of the mind  And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind.""  - Our Lady of Mount Carmel Hymn  Michael was the first openly gay man that I met in life. Every day after World Literature we would walk to the college cafeteria and eat lunch together, sometimes studying for a test, but mostly we discussed his sexuality and his faith. I was curious about him, about how he could be both gay and Christian. I grew up in a Southern Baptist tradition that labeled homosexuals as deviants who were out to corrupt Godde-fearing people. Listening and learning about life through the eyes of scared adults, anything and everything can be painted as black or white, right or wrong, and good or evil. When you are a child, it is hard to see the that the world is comprised of multiple shades of grey. Therefore, it is easy, too easy, to judge others for their differences, because you are not yet comfortable in your own skin.  At a time when I was advocating at the top of my lungs against institutionalized Christianity, Michael was advocating in favor of the church. It baffled me that he did not consider it a paradox, a contradiction, or an oxy-moron to be a gay man and a Christian. I did not understand how he could support and participate in an institution that stated that Godde hated him for who he loved. Michael told me that he believed that Godde is merciful, kind, and loving, rather than a vindictive deity that is pissed at the world. ""Sometimes the people in charge of the religion,"" he said, ""get so wrapped up in the rules that they forget about the message. The message of Godde, of Christ, is ultimately about love for your fellow man."" A few weeks later, Michael broke down another barrier of prejuidice that resided inside me. He told me that he was HIV positive. I remember that we had been sharing a basket of french fries and I was paralyzed with fear at the thought of contracting the disease. Now, I realize that it was a naive and foolish fear, but at that time it was a life-altering experience, because it showed me that who you sleep with is insignificant in the grand scheme of life.  I never saw Michael after that semester. I tried to track him down several times, but never succeeded and I have moments when I wonder if he is even still walking among us. I am convinced that he was an angel, a messenger sent to me by Godde to teach me about compassion, honesty, and love. In light of recent events that have taken place within my community of faith, I have thought about my friendship with Michael more and more and I often wonder what he would think of all this controversy surrounding a gay man that wants to bring people closer to Godde. To me it is clear that Godde places people in our lives to teach, inspire, and make us better human beings. Godde does not discriminate and I am very proud of the Episcopal church for recognizing that truth by ordaining Gene Robinson. I will stand by my church and my faith, regardless of the political ramifications that come from this decision. It is my firm belief that, eventually, we will all have to answer for our actions. To the individuals that are quick to suggest that Gene Robinson will be punished by Godde for his relationship with a man, may I remind you all that casting judgement is also considered to be a sin. Instead of pointing fingers, learn from this man. Open your hearts and embrace the message that is being sent to you.

      A couple of years ago, I wrote a short story entitled, ""Faith is a Funny Thing."" I wrote this story at a time in my life when my quest for spiritual direction was beginning to resemble a fruitless search for a needle in a haystack. In the story, a young woman find solace in a dusty cathedral, the very institution that she spent years denouncing. It was a piece that would foreshadow my return to the church in the years to come.  I was a spiritual pilgrim for the span of a decade, researching and practicing a variety of religions. I attended a service at a Jewish synagogue, read Thich Nhat Hanh's  Living Buddha, Living Christ , held a full moon ritual in my living room, and attended Catholic Mass on a Sunday afternoon. In Yann Martel's  The Life of Pi , the main character, Pi, practices a multiplicity of religions and sees no conflict in his syncretism. Halfway through the book, Pi and his family are walking through town and are approached by the leaders of the local temple, church, and mosque. Each leader tells Pi that he must chose a religion to practice. He can be a devout Hindu, Christian, or Muslim, but he can not practice all three faiths at the same time. Pi remarks that all he wants to do is love God. The church leaders are speechless at the simplicity of that statement.  I love to tell people the story of my return to the church. I tell them that I am a Christian because of a conversation that I had with a Pagan. My good friend, Loria, listened to me rant on and on about my spiritual crisis until finally she told me that there was no shame in being Christian. She reminded me that there are a lot of interpretations of what it means to be a Christian, that Jesus was a profound teacher and prophet, and that a great deal of beauty remains in the Christian tradition. You just have to find a community that you feel comfortable attending. I did.  I am an Episcopalian. I am an open-minded, syncretic, goddess-loving, liberal, Celtic Christian-Buddhist. I believe that Jesus was sent to the Earth to teach and inspire humankind. I believe that Godde is both masculine and feminine and that He/She resides in every single heart that beats on this planet. I am addicted to Sufi poetry, Buddhist philosophy, and Celtic rituals. Religion, faith, is not about the rules, but what road the heart travels. If our motive in life is to love Godde, regardless of the form that being/spirit takes, then does it really matter how we go about expressing that love? My answer is no, it does not matter. Rituals, words, and theology are wonderful things until they begin to place limitations on a person's soul. In the end, what matters the most is how that person uses their faith in the world. Their actions towards other human beings are a reflection of their interpretation of Godde.  The rest is just ashes and dust.

       I believe in eating. I think women especially have this fear of eating, and I think there is a whole euphoric plane you can rise to when you have a good meal. You sit down and with every bite you honestly just say thank you.    (Tori Amos)  I was eight years old when I went on my first diet. I have this memory of standing on the scales in the pediatrician's office and hearing the doctor tell my mother that I was fat. As an adult, I look at pictures taken of me during that time and I often wonder what the doctor was thinking. I looked like a healthy, active eight year old girl. My mother immediately put me on a diet. She gave my grandmother the strictest orders not to let me eat anything other than cantaloupe for a snack. Nan took pity on me after the second week of scarfing down cantaloupe; she gave me cookies and ate the fruit herself. I have not eaten cantaloupe since that summer.  My weight haunts me. It speaks to me, nit-picks me in the guise of voices from the past; Lance Crane telling our fifth grade classmates that there would be no more ice cream left once I went through the serving line, the constant pressure of being stick thin in high school, and my best guy friend from college telling me that men did not like girls with guts and if I wanted a boyfriend then I would have to lose weight, because no guy would want me otherwise. These are the things that I think about when I am in the presence of a man, even if that man is my lover. I know that it does not do well to dwell on the past, but when you spend your life hearing that you are less because you are more, it is hard to believe that beauty resides within your body.  I do not blame my mother for her obsession with my weight. It seems that she too was contantly struggling with her self-esteem in that realm. In her mind big was a simple translation for ugly and so I can not hold her actions against her, because she was suffering from the same societal ideals of beauty. She was struggling to feel beautiful and she wanted me to not have that struggle. It amazes me how many beautiful women, who I am surrounded by on a daily basis, think that they are hiddeous. I read my livejournal, talk to my co-workers, listen to my friends; all of them think that they are less than wonderful, because this world, this culture tells them that they are worthless unless they have Sarah Jessica Parker's body, a body that has no curves, very little cleavage, and is nothing but skin drawn taunt over bone. How is that beautiful?  I stand in front of the mirror naked and I like what I see. I walk around my apartment without clothes, because I am, finally, learning to be comfortable in my own skin. It has nothing to do with being sexy, although if you ask me I will tell you that I am sexy, and everything to do with feeling at ease with the woman that I have become. Yes, I want to lose a few more pounds, for health reasons. Next week, I am going back to the pool and swimming laps, because I miss the feel of the water between my thighs and the burning in my lungs when I am holding my breathe. I want to, once again, be addicted to the feel of gliding through the water. I used to swim two miles non-stop, the equivalent of 72 laps in an Olympic-size pool, and I want that to happen again.  Until then, I will continue to stand in front of the mirror and celebrate my hips that could bring children into this world with great ease, my breasts that are full and lovely and tinted at the tips with a shade of pink, and my back, which is smooth and, in my opinion, flawless. I am a work of art, because Godde made me. As women, we must learn to embrace ourselves and not fall victim to the societal contructs of beauty. If society had its way, I would be the size of my letter-opener, quiet, docile, and submissive.  No. Fucking. Thank You.

       This one is for you, Dad.   I want to talk about censorship. I want to talk about what happens when you get home after a hard day and find that you father has left a message on your machine, telling you that he read your website and that he thinks that using the ""f-word"" to make a point is very inappropriate. If it were any other person, I would launch into a lecture about my right to free speech, free assembly, and the academic concept of language reclamation. However, when it is with my father, confrontation seems more difficult, because I was daddy's little girl long before I was a feminist.  When you plant your feet, heart, mind, and soul under the banner of feminism, loving men reaches a level of frustration that is unparallel to any other experience. There are a great number of men who continue to identify feminism as an anti-male campaign. This is a lie. The complexity with feminism and my relationship with my father is that it is difficult to play out simultaneous roles. I can no longer play the role of dutiful daughter, because the woman inside me is demanding justice. I can no longer pretend that my father is a paragon of perfection, because humans are flawed. For any woman who once thought that her father walked on water, it is a hard lesson to learn when you discover that you are a disappointment to the man who gave you life.  I am sorry that I disappointed you, Dad. I am sorry that you think there is hypocrisy in my lifestyle because I use vulgar language and then call myself a Christian, but I will not censor myself for anyone, especially not for you. You were the person who taught me to be strong, to never settle, to always be true to myself, and to believe that I could do anything that I put my mind to. Now, you are telling me that the way that I conduct myself is inappropriate and even though you do not verbalize it, the insinuation in your message is this;  the man who I adore most in the world is ashamed of me.   That is a bitter pill to swallow, even for the most ardent feminist. I still remember what it felt like to be the pride and joy in your life and thought it sounds selfish -even to my own ears- it hurts to even consider the possibility that those feelings are no longer present in your heart when you think of me.

      Sunday evening, I went to church for the first time since my confirmation in June. It is pathetic and sad, how distracted I became this past summer. Lust overcame my heart and I pulled away from Godde, deserting my faith for the simple pleasures of the skin. Yet, when the inevitable happened and that man disappeared from my life, I found myself clinging to my faith like a life-raft. Godde became my glue and she held me together during that horrible time, when I felt him slip through my fingers. Godde continues to hold me together as I am writing these words.  It felt like coming home when I received communion. I could feel this overwhelming sense of purpose and direction flood through my body, melting into my soul. When I tasted the bread, for the first time in months, it had a dry bitter flavor, but it connected me with the others in the church. When I drank the wine, I could feel the blood of Christ renewing me, strenghtening me, preparing me for the road ahead. Catholics believe that the Eucharist involves the process of transubstantiation, where the bread and wine are, literally, the body and blood of Christ. Episcopalians recognize this belief, but tend to view the Eucharist as a symbolic act, rather than a literal one.  In my opinion, Christianity is about the blessing of this sacrament. Long before there were numerous denominations, the early Christians were meeting in secret to receive bread and wine. They risked persecution, even became martyrs, for this simple act. The Eucharist is an invisible rope that, through this acknowledgement of the sacrifice of Christ, binds Christians to one another.  Growing up in a Southern Baptist tradition, I received communion during two services a year, Christmas and Easter. I never considered communion to be an active part of the faith and when I started attending services at the Episcopal church, I thought it strange that Episcopalians received the Eucharist every single Sunday without fail. Now, I can no longer imagine going to church and not receiving communion before I go out into the world. It is the ultimate business card,  please, take our Savior with you. His body and blood are yours, if you wish to carry it inside of you . It is an incredible gift.  This is the reason that I am a Christian. The Eucharist brought me comfort when my relationship with Gene was falling apart. I know that there are a number of theological interpretations within the world-wide Christian community, so many that at times it seems as if that community will fall apart. The Eucharist is what binds us together in the face of adversity and change. It is an integral part of the faith. It is what brings Christians back into the church, even after they have been gone for days, weeks, months, and even years.  It is a blessing. It is home.

      Fortune cookies are beautiful things. I get excited, like a school-girl in a candy shop, at the very thought of what the Fates are contemplating sending in my direction. I hold on to my fortunes, those little paper notes that following in the wake of a simple cracking of a cookie.  I have it taped to my computer monitor, this one fortune that reminds me to savor life and live for the moment.  You will discover the truth in time . I meditate on these words every single day, searching for a better understanding of what they mean in relation to my life. At first, I thought the note was a message from Godde about my ex-boyfriend, putting me at ease about our troubled relationship, letting me know that we would overcome our differences and move forward together. How naive was I, to think that I knew the meaning of truth, the meaning of time?  There are moments in my life, where I feel like I am in a rush to learn everything at once. I worry that I will run out of time and that I will never discover the truth about myself, this world, and Godde. I obsess over the fear that I will never find a safe, comfortable, loving relationship with a man. There are so many items that occupy my mind, that drive me to distraction. It is only my faith, my love for Godde, that allows me to take a deep breath and force these thoughts out of my mind. I remind myself that there is a plan, a purpose.  Despite the presence of my fears, I feel more grounded now than I have at any other point in my life. I have a wonderful job and my career goals for the future have come full circle in the wake of my return to school. I am surrounded by the most incredible support network of family and friends. I go to an incredible church, a place where I am encouraged to think about my faith instead of blindly accepting doctrine. I have a cat who adores me. Truly, I am a blessed woman.

      I came here, once or twice since I last wrote, with no topic in my mind. I came here with a voice, but no words to give that voice a contextual meaning. What should I write about in this space? Should I tell you about my ex-boyfriend, how his memory continues to break me, even after he abdicated from my love? Should I discuss the weather, the change of colors and climate? Perhaps, I could write about my indecisiveness regarding the future; professional and personal?  With each passing day, I am becoming more of an introvert, more shy with the world. I enjoy my new-found solitude, but I would be lying if I did not admit that there are times when the loneliness hits me hard. There are times when I wish for a companion, preferably of the male variety. I want a man in my life, not for sex or romantic love, but for friendship, for those times when I need strong arms to hold me.  I am fully aware of my faults. I am stubborn, tempermental, loud, obsessive compulsive, and a hopeless romantic. I am passionate, almost to the point of being militant, about certain issues. I have no problem with expressing my opinion, to an individual or a crowd of people. I am an emotional eater. I have a vulgar sense of humor and a tendency to use excessive amounts of profanity in any given situation.  I am picky about spelling, punctuation, and style.  For all of my faults, I have just as many good qualities. I am intelligent. I write a mean research paper. I try to see beauty in everything. I have strong faith. I like to give back to my community. I want to make the world a better place to live, especially for women and children. I want to be a role model for young girls who are searching for an idenity in this crazy messed-up world. I am compassionate and giving. I put my all into my friendships and relationships. I love sex. (Of course there are some individuals who would argue that this is a negative quality. Screw them.) I am honest. Also, while I may never win the Miss America pagent and I know that I have some weight to lose, I do not believe that I am hard on the eyes. I can look myself in the mirror and see a valuable woman who posesses beauty, even if it is of the inward variety.  I am not perfect, but I have worth.

      October is a difficult month for me. Three years ago, Nan died on Friday the thirteenth.  She died in her sleep; she had sat down to take a nap during the middle of the day and when her daughter came home from work, she discovered that her mother was no longer among the living.  The funeral took place on what would have been an otherwise gorgeous autumn afternoon. As I watched her casket being lowered into the ground, I could not help but ponder the irony of burying my grandmother, my spiritual rock, on such a day as that one.  A couple of years later, my family buried our beloved pet, Freckles, after he lost a brief, yet painful, battle with liver disease, an ailment that is very common amongst male cocker spaniels. It happened so fast and I will never forget my mother calling me and tearfully telling me about his passing. She loved that dog.  It seems that there is so much pain in life. Sometimes, I want to wail against Godde, because I know that she has the power to cease the world's suffering and sadness. Then, there are moments that I know I am growing stronger, because of the suffering that I have had to endure at times. The fall is the perfect time of year to reflect on that strength. In the tradition of the Celts, the autumn season has become my personal New Year's celebration. I use this time to re-focus my goals, especially since I have a habit of getting distracted over the summer. This is the time of year that I pay homage to those individuals who have passed through the veil.  I miss her. There are still days where I feel an overwhelming need to hear her voice over the phone or to hold her hand. When I realize that this is no longer a possibility, there is a sharp pain that runs straight through my heart. It takes my breath away and I start to leak silent tears.

       I watch the students in this college town. You would think they're carefree, I have seen their trials, Frowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles, With every new idea, wondering if they've changed at all, Then they turn away, it happens every day.  - Dar Williams,  The Green World    I want to talk about responsibility. Oftentimes, I feel that pressure of responsibility, the higher moral obligation to make the world a better place for us to live. There are those individuals who mock my idealistic desires, but for me, being an optimist is the only way to survive in this crazy place. My faith in Godde prevents me from becoming the World's Greatest Cynic. I am a natural optimist, always wanting to see the good in people and their motivations, and I feel absolutely no shame about that fact.  Mother Teresa stated that, ""In this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love."" Indeed, it is the small things that make the most difference. The environment is a good example of this point and I have made it a part of said higher obligation to protect the space in which I live. I drive a car that gets good gas-mileage and has the lowest emissions rating in the country. I car-pool to places when it is possible. I recycle paper, plastic, aluminium, and glass products. I take my own shopping bags, made out of thick cloth, to the grocery store and if I am forced to use the plastic bags, I keep and re-use them to carry my lunch to work during the week.  Perhaps it is naive of me to be so sure that my actions, alone, can change the world. Certainly, other people think in such terms. On more than one occasion, I have been labeled as a  bleeding heart , a  touchy-feely liberal , and a  hippie tree hugger . I have grown immune to such attempts at attacking my desire, my need, to keep this place clean. I refuse to believe that it is a bad thing to want to leave something beautiful for those who, years after I am gone, will walk this land. Godde did not give us this land to plunder with shameless abandon. When you rape the land, you are, for all intents and purposes, raping Godde, because  She is the land . This type of language, this violent metaphor, is harsh, but true. I am a firm believer in honesty, a trait which far too many individuals have lost sight of and no longer value. We are tied to this place. We are tied to Her. If we, as a society, destroy our planet, then we will be destroying the gift that Godde gave to us. We will be destroying our own lives, the lives of our children, and Godde Herself.

      I was never one of those girls. I never planned my wedding, most of my Barbie dolls eloped rather than having a frou-frou ceremony. I did not keep a scrapbook full of pictures of rings, dresses, and cakes. In college, when I first discovered feminism, I proclaimed at the top of my lungs that marriage was a patriarchal institution and there was no way that I was going to willingly participate in the ultimate downfall of women. Yet, the entire time that I went through that militant phase I had a dirty little secret.  I wanted to be married. I wanted to fall in love with a man.  Now, I am older and a bit wiser. I recognize that I can be both, a feminist and a wife. In the last few weeks, I have been contemplating this topic, mostly because I have a great number of friends who either are married or are engaged to be married. I find myself turning into one of those women; clipping dresses and rings out of magazines, thinking about ceremonies, but most of all looking for the ever elusive  Mr. Right . My feminist self knows that such a creature does not exist. I am too cynical to believe, truly, in faerytales. I am no longer viewing the world through child-like eyes. However, the hopeless romantic in me will not stop looking for this individual.  I would be lying if I said that I was not ready for love. I would love to be in a relationship with a man, a committed union with someone who wanted to spend his life with me. The problem is that I am not ready to give up all of the things that I would, most likely, need to sacrifice in order to be with this person; traveling abroad, working in Washington D.C., getting my doctorate. I am not sure if I am ready to be that unselfish with my time and energy.  What is problematic about this situation is that I give my heart away with too much ease. I am a hopeless romantic and caring for other people is second nature to me, not because I am a woman, but because I am me. It is a seamless part of my identity that I can not divorce from other parts of my life. I crave a partner, a companion, like most of the world. I want to fall in love with a man who would be willing to move to another city/state/country for my career. I want to be involved with a man who is my best friend and loves me because of my flaws and not in spite of them.  The hard part about contemplating issues, such as this one, over which I have no control is that I am afraid of the hard, realistic possibility that I may never find this individual. However, I have faith that things will follow the path that they are meant to travel. In the meantime, I am going to take a deep breath and focus on taking life one day at a time.

      There are days when I feel as new to the experience of living as a newborn child. Those moments often seem so simple that I am certain that I am missing a bigger lesson. Like a speeding car, it passes me by and leaves me standing, searching, on some lonely dirt road called life.  Introspection, as wonderful as it is, can be a dangerous thing. Thinking too much and too hard about a particular topic will wear you down, emotionally and mentally, and leave you more confused than when you began your ponderings. I think that Pooh had it right all along; life, and all the tiny moments that comprise it, just  is , not this insatiable push for progress that the human race seems hell bent on completing.  Right now, I am studying for a final exam, writing a paper, and trying not to pull out every single strand of my hair. Right now, I am learning to sit back, relax, and breathe. The world may not revolve around me, but it will wait on me for a little while.

      I think that men, when they are first introduced to me, forget that I am a woman. It is easy for them to see me as the embodiment of a label, a definition. They think that they know everything there is to know about my life, because I call myself a feminist. Assumptions get made at the drop of a hat; I am most definately a man-hater, I am probably a lesbian, and it is incredibly suspect that I have a good, healthy relationship with my father.  If I were to place an open advertisement for a life-partner, it would read  single, open-minded, slightly-dorky, academic-type woman seeks single, open-minded, funny man for a life-long commitment, which will include evenings of intellectual ramblings on feminist theory, very bad cooking, obsessive devotion to the art of shagging, cat hair that covers every conceivable surface, eventual birth of children, a house by the sea, and a woman who will stand by your side, no matter what life throws at you.   I am too honest for my own good. Most women hide those dark parts, waiting for the moment to reveal thier true nature. I do not live my life in such a manipulative fashion, chosing instead to be completely honest and open about who I am as a woman, for better and for worse. I do not believe in the artificial and it is that dislike for artifice that creates my disdain for dating. In my mind, in my experience, dating is fake.  I do not want a romantic illusion, I want a real person in my life, to share my life. I want someone who forgets to leave the toilet seat down and can laugh at his own mistakes and weaknesses. I want a man who thinks that I am beautiful without make-up and who understands that kissing is not a prelude to sex, but a pleasure that is to be explored and enjoyed on its own merit. I want someone who will not run out the door, but will chose to stay by my side the morning after we have made love.  I want passion, truth, and someone who is not afraid to love me. Most of all, I want a man who understands that I am a strong-willed, take-charge, opinionated, refuse-to-be-a-doormate type of person; however, at the end of the day, I want to come home and have someone take care of me.  In a word, I want  acceptance .

      I believe in things that I cannot see with my eyes. I hold stock, importance and prominence, in the rest of the senses; touch, taste, hear, and smell. Yesterday, I celebrated the birth of a miraculous man. I cannot prove that he was the son of Godde, but I feel that particular truth down in the depths of my bones. However, he is not the only truth in which I believe nor does my belief in him negate or make impossible the existence of other esteemable tenants.  I consider myself a Celtic-Christo-Episco-Pagan, who follows the teachings of Jesus and pays homage to the Goddess. I believe in the existence of faeries, Santa Claus, elves, unicorns; all forms of magic that can only be found by paying attention, by listening to that child-like voice that lives inside of me, a voice that has the potential to disappear if we, human beings, do not guard it with care and love. I hold the words of Buddha close to my heart and I have a penchant for Islamic spiritual poetry. I follow the religious path of the ancient Celtic Church. I use my rosary for prayer and meditation.  I believe that evil exists, but I also believe in the overwhelming nature of Good, of Godde. Godde speaks to every man and woman, through every race, religion, and creed. Godde is not reserved for one nation or one brand of theology, but embraces and can be embraced by all who walk this planet. Beauty, happiness and fulfillment, can be found in every tradition.  Regardless of your path, I wish you a Blessed Christmas and a Happy New Year.

      There are some occasions for which Hallmark has no appropriate card to give to another human being. There is no card that expresses a proper sentiment for the friend who has been laid off from work for the second time in three years, for the woman who choses to have an abortion and struggles with that decision for the rest of her life, or for the man who is diagnosed with HIV and is forced to reconcile himself with the fact that he is dying.  There is no card for my friend, and co-worker, Nancy who was diagnosed with cancer and has spent the last three years battling this disease. Last week, I discovered that her doctor found four tumors in Nancy's brain and that her chances of living to see another year are very slim. I am struggling with the injustice of this revelation. It is times like these that cause me to question Godde's purpose for people. Is this kind of action the definition of mercy? Is it right for a woman, an individual who has never been anything but wonderful to her co-workers and friends, to suffer in such a manner? How does a person live out the remainder of their life, knowing that with each rotation of the sun they are one day closer to leaving behind all that they have ever known?  Sometimes, there are simply no words for the moment, no words to describe the shock you feel at learning that a person in your life will no longer be there to grace you with their smile. There are no words for the sadness, the frustration, and the anger that is felt when good people are forced to suffer and carry an unbearable burden, while the dregs of humanity walk the world and feel no consequences for their actions.  This is the hardest part about being a person of faith, not the theology that you adhere to nor the manner in which you daily practice the rituals of your religion, but the need to keep your hand tight around the tenuous thread of hope. The most difficult thing in the world is to have faith when the entire world tries to pull you away from it.

      I wait for the Red, red - the flow that marks me as a woman.   Crimson guilt Of sins once done, Committed In a brazen act Of passion.   Once more, I pay the price Of using my body To speak the language of liberation.   When did the faerie dust disappear? Did my mother Put Away My favorite doll?   I remember a simpler time, Before the Red Sea (with all its glorious might) Swept away my body Leaving my soul in her wake.   This is a moment That belongs to Every Woman.   A scare, A lunar flow unshed, A potential choice that devastates, And a false line that burns Bright pink.   Hope lies in a cardboard box.

      Feminism is like any other ideology. It shifts, morphs, over time and different people interpret the ideology in a plethora of ways.  For me, feminism is mother's milk, a liquid that runs through my veins and becomes one with my life's blood.  I am unable to separate my affiliation with feminism from the rest of my life.  It is part of my DNA to be a strong woman, but every now and then I forget that I have that strength and fortitude.  I neglect that part of myself that can conquer the world, that will be an individual.  I am having a revival of my political alignment.  In the last few weeks, I have struggled with what it means to be a Christian and a feminist, my weight and self-worth issues, and sexual harrassment in the workplace.  Yesterday, I realized that I had been living my life in a vacuum, head buried under sand, letting events and opportunities pass me by without second glance.  Ani DiFranco sings that,  us people are just poems / we're 90% metaphor / with a leanness of meaning / approaching hyper-distillation / and once upon a time / we were moonshine .  Once upon a time, we were pure, rid of societal impurity.  I want to reclaim that fierceness, that independence of mind and self once more.  I want to recover my strength from the terror that I experienced on the morning of yesterday.  No longer will I be claustrophobic, held back from the world for fear of making mistakes and disappointing other people in my life.  I want to eat, sleep, drink, fuck and breathe feminism through my pores.  This may no make sense to you, those individuals in cyberspace who know nothing about me but for the words that I write.  This may seem a jumble, a hodge-podge of vernacular guaranteed to confuse the mind and cause the heart to twist and turn.  It is none of these things and all of these things at once.  This is a statement.  This is a manifesto.  I am a woman who believes, who lives her life under the concept, that feminism can and will free men and women.  I am a white, anglophile, heterosexual, woman-loving, socially-liberal, fiscally-responsible, pro-choice, veggie-tree-hugger, rockin' mama, intellectual, believer in fae feminist.  No longer will I feel as if I am less of a woman, because I expect more from men; more being equality, respect, love, friendship, lust, and decency.  After all, would you expect any less of a poem?

       Procrastination, to be sure, is an artform.  It is one that I have cultivated through many years of school, secondary and post-secondary education.  There are days when it seems that I will never be motivated enough to pursue academia and then there are moments where it feels as though I am meant to be nothing but an academic, that scholarship and research will be my life.   The hard part about going to graduate school on a part-time basis is finding the time to live.  When you are an undergraduate student, your job is school and your life is a separate entity.  When you work for a living and go to school at night, school, suddenly, becomes your life.  All other aspects of daily living fall by the wayside and you are plunged into a monotonous routine of work and school, work and school, work and school.   Procrastination, as a result, becomes more than an artform.  It becomes as essential to life and breathing air and drinking water.  It becomes sex, something that we do not need to survive, but is something that we cannot imagine living without.   Therefore, one could conclude, procrastination is nothing short of fucking with our own self.

      I am having a hard time making decisions lately.  This summer semester has been really difficult for me to get through.  For some reason, I am not liking school as much as I thought I would.  Truth be told, I hate writing papers and sitting through hours of class lectures.  I am not sure if this is a phase, but more and more I am beginning to believe that I am not cut out for academia.  I want to teach.  I want a classroom.  I want a life outside of publishing and research.  I am so bloody sick of writing about women, gender, and feminism.  To think that I wanted, thought that I wanted, to study this material for the rest of my life.  I love being a feminist, but I hate writing about it.  I hate the theory behind it.  I want to be a practicing feminist, not a stuff academic one.  There are times where it seems that I am not meant to be anything but an academic, then I start thinking about all the years of school that I have left in store for me.  At best, I will complete school by thirty-three.  Not old at all, but do I want to be in school for that long?  I am not sure.  Right now, I just want to get through this fucking semester.

       So small and fearless My fickle heart,  My brave path, My one true love.  A list of sins Follow in my wake, Trailing after me.  Give me amnesty, Sophia. Protect my mourning soul And comfort my love-starved self.  I cling to you. I pine for your presence,     Godde. Waiting anxiously for the taste     of your salvation     upon my lips.  I imagine salvation tastes     - like honey.     - like green tea and jasmine.      -like salt licked from a man's       post-coital, sweat-soaked back. I imagine salvation tastes Wonderful.  Who do I have to fear In this colourful (colour-stained) world?  What pagan soul have I unravelled With my Jesus-freak sensibilities?  In a woman's arms, Your arms, I wish to lie.  You seem like grace incarnate to me.  Godde is manifest. Not unreachable. Eager to be traced.  The small of a woman's back,     (the gateway to the womb) The curve of her neck     (the matching pulse point of life) Laying shallow into the valley Of her breasts     (the center of her heart).  Godde     pulses,     sweats,     and breathes Alive in us all.

       urlLink Affordances and Design ( jnd.org ) : ""The word 'affordance' was originally invented by the perceptual psychologist J. J. Gibson (1977, 1979) to refer to the actionable properties between the world and an actor (a person or animal). To Gibson, affordances are a relationship. They are a part of nature: they do not have to be visible, known, or desirable. Some affordances are yet to be discovered. Some are dangerous. I suspect that none of us know all the affordances of even everyday objects.""

      Nearly 80 percent of UK central government Web sites need to be redesigned before they can be fully accessible to users with disabilities, a report has found.     Did you know you can get the e-Government Digest sent direct to your inbox every week? Just email us to get your free copy.   A UK publication called eGov Monitor Weekly has reported that around 800 public sector Web sites may need rebuilding to comply with accessibility laws requiring government services to cater for people with disabilities.   The claim is based on details leaked from an internal report carried out by the Office of the e-Envoy (OeE), the cabinet office unit responsible among other things for improving the accessibility and usability of UK government Web sites.   The OeE report draws upon the findings by the National Audit Office investigation, which examined the accessibility of 65 central government Web sites and concluded that nearly all were potentially excluding users.   EGov Monitor estimates that to fix the problems, government departments may need to spend at least 10 percent to 15 percent of their total annual budget for Web sites. Editor Ian Cuddy told ElectricNews.Net that it was difficult to put a precise figure on the total cost of the redesigns required because the OeE has refused to release further details of the audit, but it is expected to run into millions.   The OeE has now warned the Web design industry that future government contracts will demand that companies deliver Web sites that conform to international Web accessibility standards. Current responsibility for adopting these standards rests with individual government webmasters, not designers, and compliance is not centrally monitored.    urlLink ElectricNews.net:News:UK must redesign e-gov sites: report

      ABBOTT: Super Duper computer store. Can I help you?   COSTELLO: Thanks. I'm setting up an office in my den, and I'm thinking about buying a computer.   ABBOTT: Mac?   COSTELLO: No, the name's Lou.   ABBOTT: Your computer?   COSTELLO: I don't own a computer. I want to buy one.   ABBOTT: Mac?   COSTELLO: I told you, my name's Lou.   ABBOTT: What about Windows?   COSTELLO: Why? Will it get stuffy in here?   ABBOTT: Do you want a computer with windows?   COSTELLO: I don't know. What will I see when I look in the windows?   ABBOTT: Wallpaper.   COSTELLO: Never mind the windows. I need a computer and software.   ABBOTT: Software for windows?   COSTELLO: No. On the computer! I need something I can use to write proposals track expenses and run my business. What have you got?   ABBOTT: Office.   COSTELLO: Yeah, for my office. Can you recommend anything?   ABBOTT: I just did.   COSTELLO: You just did what?   ABBOTT: Recommend something.   COSTELLO: You recommended something?   ABBOTT: Yes.   COSTELLO: For my office?   ABBOTT: Yes   COSTELLO: OK, what did you recommend for my office?   ABBOTT: Office.   COSTELLO: Yes, for my office!   ABBOTT: I recommend office with windows.   COSTELLO: I already have an office and it has windows! OK, let's just say, I m sitting at my computer and I want to type a proposal. What do I need?   ABBOTT: Word.   COSTELLO: What word?   ABBOTT: Word in office.   COSTELLO: The only word in office is office.   ABBOTT: The word in office for windows.   COSTELLO: Which word in office for windows?   ABBOTT: The word you get when you click the blue ""w.""   COSTELLO: I'm going to click your blue w if you don't start with some straight answers. OK, forget that. Can I watch movies on the Internet?   ABBOTT: Yes, you want Real One.   COSTELLO: Maybe a real one, maybe a cartoon. What I watch is none of your business. Just tell me what I need!   ABBOTT: Real One.   COSTELLO: If it's a long movie I also want to see reel 2, 3 & 4. Can I watch them?   ABBOTT: of course.   COSTELLO: Great, with what?   ABBOTT: Real One.   COSTELLO: OK, I'm at my computer and I want to watch a movie. What do I do?   ABBOTT: You click the blue ""one.""   COSTELLO: I click the blue one what?   ABBOTT: The blue 1.   COSTELLO: Is that different from the blue ""w""?   ABBOTT: The blue 1 is Real One and the blue ""w"" is Word.   COSTELLO: What word?   ABBOTT: The Word in Office for Windows.   COSTELLO: But there's three words in office for windows!   ABBOTT: No, just one. But it's the most popular Word in the world.   COSTELLO: It is?

       urlLink BBC article:    Opening hours row at cottage: The cottage was opened as a museum in 1924. A heritage group in Stafford say they are angry at plans to cut the opening hours of one of the town's most historic landmarks despite their offers of help. The borough council says Izaak Walton's Cottage, in Shallowford, is proving expensive to run. The former home of Izaak Walton, the author of 1653 fishing book The Complete Angler, houses a collection dedicated to his life and angling. A report to councillors says that limiting access to the museum to weekends from May to August would save Â£17,000. Currently the attraction is open on weekday afternoons from April to October. 'Few opportunities' But the Izaak Walton Cottage Chapter, who have set up a charitable trust to fund the running of the cottage, said they were upset the council had not met them before making the decision. Tony Bridgett, president of the chapter, said: ""The council threatened to close the cottage 18 months ago and there was a campaign run by the people of Stafford and ourselves to keep it open. ""So in some respects we are delighted that it is staying open. ""But it is only going to open from May to the end of August, and only on Saturdays and Sundays and not bank holidays so members of the public are going to get very few opportunities to visit. ""We have some money available and the council say they haven't got any but they haven't got round to meeting us so we are able to mutually work together."" Members of the council's leisure scrutiny committee will debate the plans next week. A spokeswoman for the council said the hours had been revised to take into account when visitors most used the cottage. She said a range of events will continue to be held at the cottage and coach trips, including schools, would still be able to visit during the week.

      SpaceShipOne, the first private manned spacecraft, is undergoing final preparations before its historic flight to the edge of space on Monday. The craft, built by aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, will be launched into the sky by its carrier, White Knight, then rocket upwards to 100km (62 miles).  No private craft has ever been so high. In May, it reached 64km (40 miles) in a test flight, doubling its last best. The attempt over California's Mojave Desert is due to launch at 1330 GMT. Mr Rutan and his team from his company, Scaled Composites, hope the flight will take them closer to winning the Ansari X-prize of $10m (Â£5.7m) awarded to the first non-government, manned flight into space.   urlLink ...more

       urlLink Google, Yahoo face off in suit   Google is the darling of the Internet and seemingly at the top of its game as it charges toward a public stock offering sometime this summer.  But the Mountain View company could be paying hundreds of millions of dollars to its Sunnyvale archrival, Yahoo, if it loses a little-noticed patent lawsuit unfolding in a San Jose courtroom.  The case pits Google against Overture Services, an Internet advertising company bought by Yahoo last year. Overture claims it patented an online bidding system for ads seven months before Google introduced a similar system.  Patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit said Overture's patent claims can't be easily dismissed.  ``I think there is merit based on the breadth of the claims,'' said Dave Ashby, a patent attorney with the IP Strategy Group in Cupertino. ``I took a look at it and said, `Yep, Google does that. Yep, Google does that.' ''  A key ruling in the 2-year-old case -- which could determine whether the two sides settle or forge ahead to a jury trial -- is expected at any time, say patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit.  Advertising made up about 95 percent of Google's $1 billion in revenue last year. If the company loses the patent suit, it would probably have to pay damages, license technology from Yahoo or alter how it manages its ad system.  Overture, then known as GoTo.com, filed its patent in May 1999 for a ``system and method for influencing a position on a search result list.'' The 43-page patent application details a system in which advertisers would be able to bid for better placement of ads in search-engine results and manage their accounts through a Web browser.  The U.S. Patent Office awarded the patent July 31, 2001.  In February 2002, Google introduced its AdWords program -- a system that would eventually help reshape Internet advertising and legitimize search engines as a viable business. With AdWords, advertisers bid for the right to certain keywords. When a Google user types in that keyword as part of a search, the advertiser's pitch shows up near the results.  A tour operator in Hawaii, for example, might buy the terms ``Hawaii,'' ``vacation,'' ``volcano'' and ``beach,'' and its ads will appear next to Google search results for those terms. Advertisers bid against one another for keywords, with higher bidders getting better ad placement.  In its suit, filed in April 2002, Overture says Google is ``willfully'' and ``directly infringing'' on its patent. The company is seeking triple damages.  Google, which is in a mandated ``quiet period'' leading up to its IPO, declined to comment on the suit, as did attorneys representing both companies.  But in court documents, the company denies Overture's allegations. Among other things, Google is claiming that Overture was using its advertising system for more than a year before it filed for its patent. Patent law gives people a year to file patents after inventing something; a late filing automatically invalidates the patent.  Patent attorneys who have reviewed court documents have mixed views on Overture's chances of prevailing.  Mitchell Rosenfeld, a patent attorney with Capstone Law Group in San Mateo, said Google has submitted substantial evidence to show that Overture missed the one-year deadline.  Rosenfeld said a key issue in the case could end up being whether Overture was testing its technology or using a finished product.  On the other hand, Overture needs only to prove that Google infringed on one of the 67 claims in its patent. Also, Overture's patent application appears to have been well-researched by both the company and the patent office, said Bruce Sunstein of Bromberg & Sunstein in Boston.  ``This is going to be a patent that is relatively difficult to knock out,'' Sunstein said.  Since late March, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, a former patent attorney, has been analyzing the scope and meaning of Overture's patent, poring over each word and studying terminology such as ``database'' and ``search result list.'' It's a crucial step before a jury can be asked to decide whether a company has infringed on a patent. A ruling could come any day.  Known as ``Markman'' rulings, these decisions are often tipping points in patent cases, said patent attorney John Ferrell, co-founder of Carr & Ferrell in Palo Alto.  If the judge does not agree with one side's interpretation of the patent language, it will often push to settle the suit, he said.  The case is especially intriguing now that Internet search engines have become big business. When the suit was filed two years ago, Overture was suing an up-and-coming search engine with an unproven business model.  Today, Google is considered the king of Internet search. And Overture's stature increased when Yahoo acquired the company for $1.83 billion in stock and cash, incorporating its advertising technology and patents into its services.  ``It's one of those things that two or three years ago wouldn't have been an issue,'' said Andy Beal, vice president of search marketing for WebSourced. ``But it just goes to show you how big search is.''  About half of all patent verdicts are overturned on appeal. And the stakes are high. Ultimately, the two sides will have to weigh the costs of a prolonged legal fight -- attorney bills in a case like this could reach $1 million a year -- against the possibility of losing.  ``My observation is that there is this big lawsuit between two enormous players,'' Ashby said, ``and no one is paying attention to it.''

The offence would become extradictable, letting police make overseas hackers stand trial in the UK.  An all-party group of MPs looking into computer crime yesterday said that the current six-month sentence for hacking needed increasing to ï¿½send a clear signal that society now takes ï¿½hacking offencesï¿½ rather more seriously than in 1990ï¿½.    The All-party Parliamentary Internet Group (APIG) also recommended that a new offence be created to target cyber-criminals who try to shut websites. Experts said the new law could be used against the extortion gang that attacked gambling websites, including those run by Blue Square and Capital Sports, in the run-up to Euro 2004. The gang sent the betting sites an e-mail threatening to bring down their websites unless a ï¿½20,000 ransom was paid. ""

      Ok this is quite old but supposedly people have  urlLink the real dirt on Appleâs Cinema Displays?   While the sizes seem about right as well as the resolutions there are a couple of things that common sense just state don't work.  First of all, switching from the ADC(Apple Display Connector) to DVI.  I think Apple really likes be slick and having as few wires as possible.  With dropping ADC you lose Video, Power and USB all in one cable.  So you would go from 1 cable to 3 cables.  Which brings me to my next point, they state there will be 2 firewire ports on it.  How is this possible since ADC doesn't carry firewire signal and if they do go with DVI there would be neither USB or Firewire.  So now that's 4 wires coming out of this display.  Bleh i wouldn't mind many of these features but just don't see it happening.

      I just spent some time playing with the beta version of  urlLink Atmosphere , Adobe's new 3D environment software, and thought I'd give a couple of quick impressions.    I've always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community.  You could build all these really cool places but people couldn't interact in them.  You also couldn't easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages.  I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it didn't as far as we would have liked.  Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems.  It's not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.

      Now in Mindjack, a review of the  urlLink Xircom Wireless LAN Module  for Palm m500 handhelds.  A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting.   Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a café just felt wrong.    This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you've used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I'm talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you won't go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I've stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I can't choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all.    And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isn't just a technology, it's a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you're in a major city, chances are you'll find one before you go a block. Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.

I didn't have much in the way of expectations going in to Digifest 2002; pretty pictures, glitzy art/advertising pieces, and possibly some cool tech. I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations.   Wednesday night.  Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the ""4-D challenge"", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that I've spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself.  The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soirée before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water.

      This week's Mindjack:  urlLink Reading McLuhan  by Melanie McBride.  If there's a message of the 'for dummies' age it's that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhan's meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhan's literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught.

       urlLink Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis!     So why aren't you reading comics these days?  Really, it doesn't seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. The Western medium has cycles, and it's currently in a creative downturn. That doesn't mean there isn't excellent work being done. That simply means there's not much of it. And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I don't own a pair of Superman underpants.

Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three. Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling. To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Baker's racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on it's side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully. Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, it's easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today.

      Mindjack is back after a short break.  The new issue has  urlLink a report  on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts.  Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days. The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade. By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging.

And evolving. Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality.

      Mindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on  urlLink ethics in video game journalism  for the Online Journalism Review.  The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981.  Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.  Not much has changed in the past 20 years.  Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics.

        This is incredible.  Scientists have discovered a ""Colossal"" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found.  And it's not even fully grown.  Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration.  Just imagine that there's something like this that no one has ever seen alive.  It's interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel.  While it's great there's some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more.

      I'm pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjack's ever-growing stable of writers.  His first article,   urlLink Redefining Television  , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium.  Here's a snippet:   In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in  1984  and Ray Bradbury in  Fahrenheit 451  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they weren't that far off the mark. But here's the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, they've already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this.  To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Here's a functional definition:   Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images.   This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies.

The reason for this is simple: a government orchestrated management of the issue since the 1940s. Propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, covert actions, subversion, disruption and misdirection were used to embargo the core truth during the Cold War. It was the view (perhaps correctly so) of the United States government that introduction of the extraterrestrial reality during this period of nuclear deterrence - mutual assured destruction (MAD) - was too risky.

      Internet Explorer View Source This is just a note cast adrift on the great search engine sea, a message to those like myself, whose Windows ME System Restore has cratered some useful functions in Internet Explorer, such as View Source on the right-click menu. After a System Restore to repair some other troubles, I found that when I used the View Source command would not function, wouldn't do anything for that matter. So I searched for a fix...  Search = internet explorer windows me notepad view source won't work registry ...and variations on that theme.  Microsoft Support, you may as well ask your cat what the hell is wrong with your computer. They recommend that you clear your temporary internet files to fix the trouble. If that works for you, whoop-de-fucking-do. Other search results will get you message boards filled with users asking the same question, but they never get an answer that has anything to do with the price of tea in China.  Here is the answer... dammit. Edit your registry by running regedit, see that the following exists, it probably does not and so you must add it. Editing your registry is tricky. So if you screw up your registry, I take NO responsibility. You may want to make a backup first.  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  |- Software  |- Microsoft  |- Internet Explorer  |- View Source Editor  |- Editor Name       (Default) = C:\windows\notepad.exe  Thats it. The answer comes by way of  urlLink Vim Online , which is the only free vi type editor for Windows that I have ever found, complex, but useful if you need to edit cgi on a Windows desktop and don't have a shell account with vi available.  Thus endeth my good deed for today.

The Bush administration, meanwhile, refused to criticize Russian special forces for using the gas, which killed 116 of the hostages as well as the hostage takers.   urlLink Russian gas may be secret crowd-control weapon  Weapons experts have suggested a 1950s chemical weapon called 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, or BZ, may have been used.

The breakdown of talks come as tensions have been rising between intelligence agencies and a congressional panel investigating the Sept. 11 attacks.

I should have turned mid-stream when a slow-motion grimace drew her lips into an unpleasant pucker. She was shocked and disgusted. For her, the film was the Revolutionary War, and that was exactly how she planned to present it when she played the video for her classes.

The Moon moved closer to the Earth and became imprisoned by the Earths gravity.   Then, the Moon became the master of Earths waters. The Moons approach resulted in immense tides, volcano eruptions, and earthquakes. Waves were the height of mountains, volcanoes were erupting, and water was boiling. Probably, the new satellite was the reason for the Great Flood.

These weapons would ideally do their damage while creating only limited nuclear fallout aboveground. Such a move would represent the most significant rewriting of U.S. nuclear strategy in decades, because its intended purpose violates the two cornerstones of current policy: to use nuclear weapons only as a last resort and never to use them against nonnuclear nations.

      Fuck That Flag  A short story by the mutant.  This is a true story, or so I have been led to believe. It was told to the mutant by his friend ""Jack"". Jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as ""flag worship"".  I should mention that my friend Jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.  Jack is a mechanic. He works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. He keeps the machinery running and he likes his job. Jack is fighting terrorism his way.  A few days before the anniversary of 9/11, Jack was approached by his employer with a nice new American flag.  ""Jack, I just bought a flag.""  Jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, ""I am happy for you. What does this mean to me?""  ""You are the mechanic,"" says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic. ""Can you build us a flagpole?""  ""Yeah, I suppose I could. But it will take time away from working on our vehicles. I am not doing this on my own time.""  ""Of course.""  And so, Jack set off to build a flagpole. Jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer. He has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company. But he got on with it anyway.  Jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth. Based on these figures, Jack produced a flagpole atop the office. Old Glory fluttered in the breeze. Sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, Jack puffed with satisfaction on his Marlboro.  But all was not well my friends. No. For as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.  In the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, Jack's flagpole was 'half-assed', a first year student's attempt at an art form best left to professionals. The office dwellers complained to Jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.  ""It's not that bad,"" says Jack. ""No one can see that, it still looks OK.""  ""It's a brand new flag. It has to come down until you make the pole higher,"" says the employer.  ""That will cost more money and more time. An extension will have to be added to the pole. And I will have to build a new bracket.""  ""That's fine, do whatever you need to do.""  And so Jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof. Satisfied with his work, Jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.  The flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered Jack's accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.  ""Jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?""  ""Who is that going to impress?"" says Jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.  ""What?"" The sickness affects hearing first. ""We should have lights shine on our flagpole. Can you do that?""  I'll kill this shit thinks Jack, ""Yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work.""  ""That's OK.""  ""Is it? The electrician has to come out of the city. It will cost more time and more money.""  The increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer's brain, ""Money is not the issue. Do whatever you need to do.""  Jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set. In the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof. A mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers. The peaceful nastiness of Jack's garage was once again shattered.  Jack's employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager. By this time, the sickness was in full bloom. The office worker's need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries. It was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied. They needed more.  The office manager confronted Jack, ""We want to erect a new flagpole. How soon can you get it up there?""  ""Look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it's going to be a problem. We will have to weld it. Our welder will have to weld the poles and we'll have to mount it on the roof very securely. We are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem. We need to bail on this deal. This flag is a bad idea. It has been nothing but trouble.""  The manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred. They decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot. And they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.  And so it was that Jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.  An interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday. This is no problem he thought, I just won't be anywhere dangerous on that day. But the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at Okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy. He's done his part for his country. And now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.  The welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed. The poles Jack has been using on the roof won't do.  Being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening. It must then be folded into a triangle. And what's more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.  Jack thinks this is fine idea. Jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time. Indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on. His brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.  Jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.  The welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall. There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.  The welder took the flag with him to the VFW Hall, so if you don't get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why. Sickness takes a toll.  Soon thereafter, Jack is called into an office meeting. He stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth. Jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty. As he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.  ""What is this all about? I'm busy,"" he grumbles.  ""We need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag,"" says the office manager.  ""What flag?""  ""This is important. We need to decide how this will be handled.""  ""Do I have this right? I had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?""  The office manager can't take it anymore, ""Can I see you in here for a moment?""  They go into a private office.  ""Geez Jack, what are you a communist?""  ""No. I am a nazi.""  ""Oh God, Jack, don't say things like that. People don't think that kind of talk is funny.""  ""Ja, I am really.""  ""Look Jack, it's just a little flag.""  ""No. If I have a little flag on a wooden stick,"" waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, ""That is a little flag. You are holding a meeting for something that does not exist. I have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight AM tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do.""  ""I get it, OK. Go.""  And go he did. The manager returned to the meeting, ""I don't know. I guess he's just un-patriotic...""  Indeed. I am Jack's complete lack of patriotism.  The sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, ""Jack is un-american. Jack is a communist. Must be a democrat. Child abuse, I heard. A satanist..."" They just could not understand it. Why would anyone hate the flag so much?  Thou shalt have no other god before me. Unless it's the flag. Amen.  Jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring Jack back into the fold. Jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.  ""How much money have you spent on this flag deal?""  ""Well, the flag was a hundred dollars.""  ""And you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag.""  The boss can't believe this, ""It can't be that much."" Sick people can't count.  ""Go figure.""  He did. The boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have. Isn't that special?  Now. The electrician. Remember the electrician? The electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn't there, on the flagpole, that also isn't there.  Jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the VFW Hall. He also advised him that if these people didn't get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.  The office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go. Since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable. He also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag. Sickness causes laziness.  The electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done. And in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights. No doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.  Since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.  Enter the boss's idiot son.  The boss's son has never operated a ditcher. But since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn. Are you getting ahead of me yet?  So he's running the ditcher. Once it starts it's pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary. Jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.  ""The line turns back there,"" Jack yells over the machine noise, ""Don't you need to turn the ditcher now?""  ""Yeah, I'm going to turn it over here, in a minute.""  Jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it. Just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise. Sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.  The power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby. The phones aren't working either. No cable tv. And all eight-hundred feet of the DSL fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher's impeller.   Now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the DSL cannot easily be fixed. The repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them. And then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.  Meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the DSL is down, (don't ask me why). So, no money coming in.  The computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of Jack's computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.  Once the crisis had passed, Jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was. Jack is funny that way.  ""Fuck that flag,"" the boss said.  It is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.  Three-thousand dollars. For a flag they didn't have. On a flagpole they also didn't have.  Is there a point to my story? Well, fuck if I know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don't you?  We were talking about sickness. When illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can. Sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.  The mental illness of ""flag worship"" is different. Only a really good beating will get it out of your system.  Well anyway, that's Jack's prescription.  ---The Happy Ending---  Jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers. He went through the office passing them out.  ""One for you, and one for you..."" he sang as he went along.  He reached the office manager with the last one, ""And one for you...""  ""All right! I know just where to put it,"" said the office manager, slapping the American flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor. ""That's great!""  Indeed it was. And pretty strange behavior for a communist too, don't you think?

On Saturday morning, I slipped into and out of a top-secret area of the lab while guards sat, unaware, less than a hundred yards away.

        urlLink Sympathy For The Devil   Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June, We stood beneath an amber moon And softly murmured ""someday soon."" We kissed and clung together, Then, tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say; Now, when twilight dims the sky above Recalling thrills of our love, There's one thing I'm certain of Return I will to old Brazil.   By these terrible means, they will create a world where war conducted by any country but the United States will seem simply too risky and the Great American Peace will begin.  Unregulated Global Corporatism will be the only permissible ideology, every human will have access to McDonald's and the Home Shopping Network, all ""news"" will come through some variant of AOLTimeWarnerCNN, the Internet will be run by Microsoft, and so it will remain for a long time. Peace. On Prozac.  If I were in charge, this is neither the flavor of peace I would prefer nor the way I would achieve it. But if I'd been in charge back in 1983, there might still be a Soviet Union and we might all still be waiting for the world to end in fifteen nuclear minutes. (We aren't?)  Of course, I could be completely wrong about this. Maybe they actually are possessed of a madness to which there is no method. Maybe they really do intend to invade Iraq and for no more noble reason than giving American SUVs another 50 years of cheap gas.  We'll probably know which it's going to be sometime in the next fortnight.  By then, I expect to be dancing in Brazil, far from this heart of darkness and closer to the heart itself...

No webmaster can avoid seeking Google's approval these days, assuming he wants to increase traffic to his site. If he tries to take advantage of some of the known weaknesses in Google's semi-secret algorithms, he may find himself penalized by Google, and his traffic disappears. There are no detailed, published standards issued by Google, and there is no appeal process for penalized sites. Google is completely unaccountable. Most of the time they don't even answer email from webmasters.""   Yes indeed, most of the traffic on my website comes from Google searches, this is a bad thing? I don't have to beg Google to include my website in search results, and I don't have to include meta-tags to describe the content of my website, and Google doesn't try to pigeon-hole my website into a specific category. I make an update to my site and Google knows it, generally within hours, in short, Google bases it's search results for my website on what I have said, the content, the words, the phrases, rather than something else, so, at the risk of being redundant I will ask you again, is all this a bad thing?  Now, as I see it, the only people who would not appreciate the fact that my website outranks their own would be people with something to sell. Goodness me, my discount used gasmask website is being outranked by a weblogger, that can't be right can it? That's just unpatriotic. Yes, it can, and it probably is. I had something current to say about gasmasks, your tired old static content cannot compete. (I am talking about gasmasks right now, Google will see this, cache it, and add it to search results for gasmasks. Do you get it?)   ""There are no detailed, published standards issued by Google...""  Try including some current news about your gasmasks, with some outside linkage (get a blog dummy), use 'current event' words and phrases and news related to what you are selling, use Blogdex, use Daypop, use your brain, get some friends to link to you, be a meme-whore, then Google will stand up on it's hind legs and speak for you, that's the trick, that's the only trick that Google-dog knows. Popularity can be a good thing. People don't like static websites, I don't anyway, and in my observation, neither does Google.  I wish I had something to sell on this website, I'd be doing pretty well thanks to Google...  Of course, you could, God forbid, pay Google to put your website at the top of their search results page. I realize that just by mentioning payment for search referrals I have opened a quantum vortex that has caused the assholes of webmasters to pucker-up all over the solar system, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Oops, I did it twice didn't I?   ""Google penalizes webmasters who take advantage of their algorithms.""  Who gives a rat's ass? The guilty will be punished. For example. There is a javascript available from  urlLink here , that allows referrers to your website to be linked on your page, it's pretty cool. I installed this at the bottom of my webpage. A few days later I discover that I have lots of new friends, most of my referrals are now coming from porn sites who have nothing to do with my site, they are all just taking advantage of my little script. So sadly, the script had to be removed. Long story short, no one likes being taken advantage of. Not this little grey mutant.  Besides all that. I have to laugh. I do, I'm fucking sorry. What kind of idiot other than the ""Make A Vast Fortune At Home Selling Porn And Viagra On The Internet"" variety would concern themselves with Google's secret algorithms? I mean, there is no vast fortune to be made on the Internet, I know that for a fact, I did a search for it on Google, I hit the ""I'm feeling gullable"" button, and I didn't find a damn thing.   Google enjoys a 75 percent monopoly for all external referrals to most websites...  What you fail to mention here is that this massive number of referrals are very likely generated by a minority of users. We are busy mammals, but we are few. Do you think most people even know that they can change Internet Explorer's search page from MSN to anything else? Do you think most people even know that they can change Netscape's search page from Netscape to anything else? What do AOL users search with? Earthlink users? Do you think that Grandma even knows that Google exists?  Now. Maybe I just don't see the big picture. Maybe Google is a New World Order storefront, rife with ex-spooks who want nothing more than to use our webpage viewing habits against us? Today veblogs, tomorrow ze verld...

The actor was stopped driving into the country from Switzerland and a paper fortune was discovered in shares, bonds, cheques and credit notes.  When asked about the $8 billion Johnson, 53, allegedly said: I am going to buy a car.  According to reports a customs man replied: With that kind of money you could buy the factory.

In addition, the very volatility that makes it blaze like an atomic furnace upon impact converts a large percentage of the spent projectile into microscopic radioactive oxides that, when borne by the wind, may be inhaled by civilians miles from the battlefield.

       urlLink The Story of Mouseland by Tommy Douglas  You see, my friends, the trouble wasn't with the colour of the cat. The trouble was that they were cats. And because they were cats, they naturally looked after cats instead of mice.  Presently there came along one little mouse who had an idea. My friends, watch out for the little fellow with an idea. And he said to the other mice, ""Look fellows, why do we keep electing a government made up of cats? Why don't we elect a government made up of mice?"" ""OH,"" they said, ""he's a Bolshevik. Lock him up!"" So they put him in jail.  But I want to remind you: That you can lock up a mouse or a man but you can't lock up an idea.

Kicking the dog is cruel and brutal and it is humiliating to be called a fruit. But in comparison to our real problem  in comparison to the fact that the ship is still heading north  your grievances are petty and trivial, because if we dont get this ship turned around soon, were all going to drown.  Fascist! said the professor.  Counterrevolutionary! said the lady passenger. And all of the passengers and crew chimed in one after another, calling the cabin boy a fascist and a counterrevolutionary. They pushed him away and went back to grumbling about wages, and about blankets for women, and about the right to suck cocks, and about how the dog was treated. The ship kept sailing north, and after a while it was crushed between two icebergs and everyone drowned.

Great events in history didn't ""just happen,"" we are told, but they were planned by conspiratorial architects, acting in secret, hiding their true intentions from the ignorant masses, and carried out by dedicated, brainwashed, or fanatical followers. The founding of the Federal Reserve System, the assassinations of both Kennedys, Martin Luther King, and even John Lennon, were all planned beforehand by people in high places, in order to solidify their power. At least some people think so.  Even if all these conspiracy theories are true, they pale in significance compared to the greatest conspiracy of them all: The Christmas Conspiracy. This conspiracy is no mere theory, but inescapable fact. ( urlLink via )

Offenders would be required to sign a contract promising full participation in the program, with one exception.

The military is not attempting to hide its long-term goals.  urlLink ""Weather is a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025""  is a white paper that can be found on a Pentagon-sponsored website.  ...weather-modification is a force multiplier with tremendous power that could be exploited across the full spectrum of war-fighting environments. From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of global communications and counter-space control, weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary.  But, while offensive weather-modification efforts would certainly be undertaken by US forces with great caution and trepidation, it is clear that we cannot afford to allow an adversary to obtain an exclusive weather-modification capability.

Meanwhile, PBS refuses to air  urlLink The Greenhouse Conspiracy , a devastating critique of the science of global warming theory. PBS officials have dismissed the acclaimed British documentary as ""too one-sided.""  ""It may not quite add up to a conspiracy, but certainly a coalition of interests has promoted the greenhouse theory: scientists have needed funds, the media a story, and governments a worthy cause. And beyond that, is it the millennium that encourages notions of an apocalypse,  or simply that in a world without belief we need a catastrophe to give us something to believe in ; where for once, in a battle between nature and humankind,  we can line up on the side of good against the forces of evil.

August 2003....   urlLink The High Life  Do bugs control our weather? Can viruses travel thousands of miles on the winds? Is there a whole ecosystem up in the clouds that we have not discovered? The answer to all three questions could be yes, according to scientists who are exploring the microbial metropolises in the skies.  ...whatever the possible motives for bacteria to make clouds, one practical spin-off of their skills is that scientists might develop more efficient ""organic"" methods of seeding clouds, using bacteria instead of chemicals.   urlLink The Shield Project  Correcting the ecological damage that mankind has done has NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

As the planet's carrying capacity shrinks, an ancient pattern reemerges: the eruption of desperate, all-out wars over food, water, and energy supplies.   urlLink Major Media Finally Gets It  After years of writing about how sudden climate change could be triggered by a change in the Gulf Stream?and being totally ignored by the major media?the big news organizations are finally starting to ""get it.""

A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a 'Siberian' climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world.   urlLink Will We Tame The Climate Or Will It Finally Tame Us  ...abrupt climate change of this kind may have been the driver of the evolutionary process that eventually produced a species capable of worrying about global climate change.   urlLink William H.

       urlLink Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012  (PDF) The letter that follows takes us on a darkly imagined excursion into the future. A military coup has taken place in the United States--the year is 2012--and General Thomas E. T. Brutus, Commander-in-Chief of the Unified Armed Forces of the United States, now occupies the White House as permanent Military Plenipotentiary. His position has been ratified by a national referendum, though scattered disorders still prevail and arrests for acts of sedition are underway.  A senior retired officer of the Unified Armed Forces, known here simply as Prisoner 222305759, is one of those arrested, having been convicted by court-martial for opposing the coup. Prior to his execution, he is able to smuggle out of prison a letter to an old War College classmate discussing the ""Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012."" In it, he argues that the coup was the outgrowth of trends visible as far back as 1992. These trends were the massive diversion of military forces to civilian uses, the monolithic unification of the armed forces, and the insularity of the military community. His letter survives and is here presented verbatim.  It goes without saying (I hope) that the coup scenario above is purely a literary device intended to dramatize my concern over certain contemporary developments affecting the armed forces, and is emphatically not a prediction. -- The Author   urlLink America's military coup  ""...if there's a sentiment in the army it is: Support Our Troops, Impeach Rumsfeld"".

      okay okay okay. we know that even if I dont eat, if I dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud? I think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when I took the last meds, so I will need to talk to the doc about that. I took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it. meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm.

I will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we'll see what happens in the am. but even if I get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds. good luck to me.    ps, I ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.   bleh.

      not too good. lets see, I took the evening meds at about 5:30, but i ended up eating a big meal at about 9 or 10. I did not eat lunch, but I had an english cucumber with dressing - 6 carbs - when i took the meds, in an hour or two i was starving, so i ate about 3\4 cup of cottage cheese - 7 carbs, big hunk o' mozzarella - 4 carbs and a big bowl of kale soup - 17 carbs.   total carbs for the day less than 40, but most of them more than t hours after I took my last meds.   conclusion:   - meds are fast acting, I should eat right after I take them.   - I shouldn't eat after 9pm maybe even earlier.   HOWEVER - I haven't eaten a thing in over 8 hours, so really, this is not good.   Also, yesterday I woke feeling light and airy. Today I feel heavy. 40 carbs is probably about 500 carbs less than I normally eat in a day AND I took all three glucophage and both glipizid. I really do not want to start shootin up insulin, dammit.

      Blood has been okay i guess.. 110, 119 afte reating, 99 before aft. snack.  the people on the atkins board seem to think that fasting sugars above 100 are nt acceptable, while the ADA seems to think that up to 120 fasting is okay. so who is right? I dont think there is damage at under 120.. and my levels after eating (within one hour havent been over 140 and within 2 hours have been about 120-126, which is okay. the problem niggling me has been the morning sugars. there is definately something going on. the glucophage i beleive just increases the insulin sensitivity, the glipizid, im not sure, but I beleive it actualy decrease the sugar. So.. im going to do too things, not take my meds until after dinner, about 10 pm, and in the am, take the glipizid at 4:30 and the glucophage before breakfast.   so there.   i got the blues.

      okay, trying to outsmart this thing, I set the alarm for 4:30 am, to test and take my morning meds early.   I couldnt rouse myslef till five, and I tested (on my arm) at 114. I took only glucophage, thinking both might be too much, and what about breakfast?  went back to sleep and woke up at 9am, and my blood is 121.   shit.   then i immediately tested my leg, which showed at 130!  so the good news is, I've been probably testing too high, since leg was my testing site of choice, and  I' supposed  to be testing from my fingers or arm.   however, i cannot seem to beat this fucking high morning sugar thing.   tommorrow I will trytaking just hte glipizid, and next day, both.  but now I have to see if its going to scew up my breakfast reaction. Had about 9 grams carbs with high fiber ceral and cream this morning.

      i'm having one. although my blood sugars (hereafter known as BS) are pretty close to normal now, and my blood pressure is down as well as my pulse rate, Im pissed at my body. Im pissed that missing my meds even at this low a carb intake, causes major BS spikes, i'm not losing any weight and none of these changes has improved my housekeeping skills.   bad day, but sugars normal. 30 day avg is 110!

      this pains me. I had a salad and a nasty atkins banna muffin for dinner, and I ate at about 7pm ish.. definately didnt have any food after 8 and took my meds when I ate dinner.   so do I eat before six, do i take my meds late? do i take only the glipizid at dinner... i dont know.   it just pisses me off that I am so reducing my  carb intake and still have high morning bloods .  also, I had a dream last night, part of which included me making a take home plate at a party, from a table groaning with many many different kinds of pie.   pie.   ok and someone mentioned making faux apple pie with jicama. whaddayathink?

      the bad news is, they found a spot on my retina, and now i have to get dilated and checked (my eyeball, not my coochy, get yer mind outta the gutter) for any more abnormalities. good news is if I keep going with my sugars as I am, the problem should be arrested right here.   weird news, I decided to take back my new frames (the bifocals) because the reading glass portion wasn't strong enough and i couldn't read my beloved adult swim text from my usual perch on my bed, anymore. it seems that the blood sugar effects the lens thickness of my cornea, and now, 30 days later, my prescription has changed. so they are redoing the lenses. good thing, because the photo gray dip was crap, and they needed to dip again.   haven't eaten much today and i need to make dinner for myself and the mijo.  morning blood was 110, current blood is 90 and forgive me, but i will not stop congratulating myself for  doing well with the blood.

I have to get out of the mind set that i need to be below 100 for regular checks, mom and dad are not, so its cool to be 110 or 108. my 30 day average is below 120, and thats grand.   i am going to register a new domain so i can multi blog here, side blog daily blood and carb counts, et al.   this will cost about 80 bucks for 2 year domain reg and 1 year hosting (@logjamming.com, yay), so be tuned for a change.   my main goal right now is getting this house in order and keeping the blood sugars low. on the horizon, need to pay for west la ticket, ians sleep away camp, and car registration, with ins looming on the horizon. there fore i bought some clothes and make up.

I MUST DO THIS.  some one light a fire under my ass please.

      just ate - lamb chops and salad with cheese, tomato, cuke, cilantro and pepperoni yum. probably about 5 carbs. Had a klondyke lo-carb bar after getting that 64 reading.. it only has three net carbs, but alot of these sweet treats have sugar alchohols, great for the diabetes, but no stored fat will burn until the sugar alcohols do. still, I am feeling well in general and on the right track.   my shoulder has really been bothering me and I need to start therapy for this - apparently frozen shoulder is a symptom of diabetes. and it hurts.   took my meds and I'm going in for another salad.   night

      breakfast was late, 2 eggs, some corned beef hash and two lo carb waffles. 13 carbs total. lunch - an avacado with 8 flax seed tortilla chips - 10 carbs total. Oooh and some yummy grape k00l-aid.  yup I know this blog is boring, but its meant as a tracking diary, not track side entertainment, HOWEVER - I would like to revamp it a bit to somehow include - food diary, blood tracker, weight tracker.  what I dont want is to have to update the template every time. but it would be nice to view it simply, on a side table - such as daily blood, daily carbs, weekly weight. I love the simplicity of blogger and the fact that I can post from my pager, you must admit, is wicked cool.   I also need to take some mofugly pictures of me in a 'tard and tights or something, and update that weekly - eventually compile them into one animated gif - ""the amazingly fine shrinking kitty""  mom and pop are proud of my progress (which really should have begun 10 years ago - but ni modo) and that makes me feel fine. im such a needy kitty, requiring validation at every turn. this is why I would make a splendid rock star.

I feel its a good investment, because I will be living like this when I lose the weight. my only concern is the low carb mania. when it ends, will ben and jerry's still have low carb ice cream? miltons low carb bread? hay yi yi. I hope so, or life will be dismal indeed. diet cherry coke will save this summer for me. I feel a little  tingly and week. didnt have dinner until about ten last night. stirfry, veggies and chicken and diet soda and a glipizid. I hadnt had any meds since noon and i think my blood was high before dinner because at midnight it was 121. not horrible but would rather it was down to under 100. oh well.. im still in a good place. viva la raza!

Your's truly has visited them all. This city is also in the western state of Rajasthan. It is very hot here in the Summer and almost nobody uses an Air Conditioner. This place afforded the only stability for any length of time. As I did my Class 10th 11th and 12th here. Had a generally fun time, as everybody does in the final years of school. We visited a lot of places in Rajasthan from here. Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Bharatpur(the bird sanctuary), Mathura and had almost decided to go to Delhi in the same trip but wiser counsel prevailed.   I will want to go to this place, just to revive the memories of the good old days of school and the like.

      The next city in the current series is Allahabad. This city lies on the confluence of the three rivers the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati. However, if you pick up the Atlas, you'll see that there are only two rivers. What about the  third  river? Well! it is mythological. Yes that's right it's Mythological. it is reputed that the river Saraswati flowed there and due to some event (I don't remember what) it went underground out of shame. The rivers in India have been personified, that's how the shame factor comes into the picture.   Anyway back to the city, A nice city to live in. I did my class sixth and seventh here in different schools, namely the St Joseph's College and The Kendriya Vidyalaya, Manauri. After this city I've always studied in Kendriya Vidyalayas(Central Schools in Hindi). Amazingly there is nothing very remarkable about this city as far as modern times go. But this city is steeped in Indian Mythology. Lord Ram is said to have been here during his 14 years of forced exile. Another feature of this place, the roots of a Banyan tree which gives of leaves(you've got to see it to believe it), the very same Banyan tree is said to be several Millenia old and the British even tried to set it afire (out of plain old Malice)so that we'd lose this part of our heritage, but this tree survived and is said to be one of the largest trees in India.  There is also a tunnel which is said to go all the way from Allahabad to Delhi. People have tried to follow this tunnel but it ends due to a rockfall some distance inside. I was here during the infamous Babri Masjid (Mosque) Demolition. That was one shameful aspect of India's modern history, when a bunch of Hooligans decided to break down the Mosque. There was a lot of tension because of the demolition and the Army had to do Flag Marches and the like in certain localities to calm things down a bit. I was also here during the infamous Anti Mandal Commision riots. The riots took place because of the provision for reservation for the Backward classes in the Government jobs and other government owned and operated institutions. A lot of heartburn took place in this country because of that one man who was responsible for this. The amazing part is that man is alive and hopes to enter active politics again. (To dispel any confusion it was not Mr Mandal, But Prime Minister VP singh who actually implemented the commision report and is thus reviled for the reason).  I probably will never want to come back here again, simply because there is nothing to come back to.

It is now a non family station for people like My father meaning families of Defence Personnel and the like are not allowed there. Srinagar is famous for its Gardens by the Mughal Emperors of India in the Medeival ages, and also the Houseboats on the Dal Lake. House Boats are just that Houses on Boats, and are now used as tourist hotels. Correction,  were  used as tourist hotels, due to the activity of Pakistani Terrorists, no tourists. Not only bad for tourism but also for the local people, as tourism is the mainstay of the local economy.

Most likely, you are a woman magnet and you are never without an admirer. It appears that you have an incredible amount of charm, and your attentive and sensitive demeanor makes you irresistible. You have definitely been taught well. You know how to treat a woman, and you make sure that she feels special and appreciated by yours truly. You have a knack for expressing yourself and showing your interest, without looking too eager. That is a difficult balancing act, and you deserve a pat on the back for perfecting it. At the rate you're going, you won't be dating much longer before you score your dream girl!   I don't have a girlfriend, and with my looks never will too.

A nice place to visit for a while but horrible place to stay. a lot of picnic spots next to mountain streams and brooks, and also a lot of hiking trails, camping out is really fun here. There is no animal threat of anykind except for the occasional Leopard and the like.  Last Words: Nice place wish I could visit every Year, Unfortunately can't because of Pakistani Terrorists which makes this a non family station. Maybe in a century hence it'll be peaceful again, till then sigh

      By the way, when prez Clinton left India for Pakistan he had to use a decoy plane, The secret service feared the plane would be shot down by stinger missiles in Pakistan. Stinger missiles in Pakistan? well they were supplied with gay abandon to the Afgani's during the Afganistan war. and now are in the hands of the Pakistani terrorists.  The best part is yet to come. The CIA tried to buy back the Stingers, then they said they'd pay for photographs of the broken stingers. yes ppl it's all true, it's all happening here, the most happening place on this planet.

      Todays town is Nasirabad. this town is in the Western state of Rajasthan, this place is extremely hot in the summers and has a perenial water shortage. Nearby places of interest include Ajmer which has the Dargah(shrine) of someone famous (forgot who it was). it is rumoured the emperor Akbar himself had come here and had had his prayers fulfilled. I did class 2 and 3 here, in Battle Axe Montessori and the St. Anslem's School. Last words Okay place, absolutely no crime and I don't wanna go there again, ever..

      The next place I'm writing about is Wellington, no it is not the Wellington you're thinking of. This Wellington is in the Southern Indian state of Tamil nadu, My father was here for his Staff College Course at the Defence Services Staff College. This place too served as a jump of point visit several Southern Indian cities like Mysore, Chennai (Madras) and the like. The hill station Oooty is just a stones throw away from here. There are two ways to get to Wellington. One is to take a bus from the nearest Railhead Coimbatore, and the other is to take the toy train, just joking, it's actually a metre gauge train which has a third rail in between the two tracks to provide traction while climbing the steep hill sides. again a very Picturesque location. I did Class 1 and half of Class 2 here, we had stayed here for only 1 year. I studied in a school called the Holy Angels. The year of stay 1985.   Last words: A very sleepy town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home, I could live here, in 50 years time

      The first place I'm writing about is a place called Yol Camp, This town is based on a hillside in the Kangra district in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This place is near Dhramsala, which more famous due to the the Tibetan Government in exile. I've lived in this town twice, the first time when Iwas doing kindergarten, and then more recently in class 8th and 9th. I remember a few things from my first stay. I used to go to a school called the Sacred Heart School, which is about 8 KM away from Yol. And the other time I studied in Kendriya Vidalaya (Central School).   This place has a lot of temples around it. This place also served as a jump of point to visit other cities and towns in North India, like Pathankot, Jammu, Vaishno Devi(a very big pilgrimage spot). A very picturesque locale. As the whole town is based on the hillside, and the roads up the hill are inclined at a 70 degree angle, and is wont to happen, a lot of accidents take place.   Last words: A very Sleepy Town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home (let me otta here)

      Hello ppl, This is a brand new day (when isn't it), not very original I admit(Whoopie Goldberg in Sister Act 2), but a brand new day anyhow.   If you've heard about the recent Massacare in Kashmir my Pakistani terrorists, and feel outraged, please drop a line to your respective head of state, please also feel free to drop me a line at  webmaster@india.4mg.com  Personally I think we should retaliate in kind, 10 for every one of ours is fair enough. If that does not stop 100 for one is even fairer. If I have some smart alec who says an eye for an eye will make the world go blind, I don't mean an eye for an eye, I mean  two  eyes for an eye, we are already half blind, lets blind them altogether.  A full fledged Pentium capable PC can be made under $200, using a netappliance called i-opener by  netpliance corp . This device originally runs a  Real Time OS called  QNX . Those who don't know what a real time OS is, please visit the QNX website and see their demo at  www.qnx.com .  Just how do u do this amazing thing, go to  www.linux-hacker.net/iopener/  for more details. Don't worry the machine does not run exclusively Linux as the website indicates. It runs others too (Windows, BeOS). By the way if anybody has a recent BeOS CD (The one I have is way too old) lying about and could take the time and expense to send it to me, I'd be very grateful. Email me for more details at  cpatnaik@email.com .   If you are the anti establishment kind, you may want to visit  www.2600.com/news/1999/1112.html  for lowdown on DeCSS. 2600.com is looking for mirrors for deCSS, (yep that's the DVD ripper). Though I fail to see, how encryption would have prevented piracy, one needs only to copy the disc.  In other news a Billionaire wants to start a net Univ for free read all about it on  wired   A long entry, as you'd have guessed this was done offline. What to do? Web is very expensive in this part of the world. ;) Cheerio, I really am hoping that they'd devise a way to update by email, and while they're at it also an offline client (I know know, totally contrary to the spirit of a blog, but no harm wishing it)

      My first post to my blog,  Those Paki's (Pakistanis)ought to be fried in hot oil, maybe even roasted in the warm glow of Nuclear radiation.   In brief the rant is as follows: Pakistan (a country with delusions of grandeur) claims that Kashmir is a part of their country, when actually it is part of mine. Their (The Pakis) country has been a breeding ground for terrorists like a piece of rotten wood is a breeding ground for Fungus. I believe that the Western media has still not emerged from their cold war mindset, is shown by the fact that whatever India does is a Human rights violation and whatever the terrorists do are legitimate acts towards freedom. Also seen in their attitude in Chechnya. When the Russians bombed that place to oblivion, it was a gross violation of Human rights, when Americans and the rest did the same in Yugoslavia it was a fight for the good of mankind (certainly not that of the Yugoslavians)  Do hungry people a favour click on this link  urlLink The Hunger Site     Have decided to implement a new navigation system for my website which is located at  urlLink http://india.4mg.com .

      My favourite place of the lot is Pune. This maybe so because I did my graduation here and lived here foir two years in a hostel.I visit this place once in a couple of months, the fact that this place is only 4 hrs away also helps. A very very nice place to live in, I'd like to live here, if I I get a job or something like that. This place is a 4 hour train ride from Bombay, and a retirement city so to speak. though it is changing for the better now. It is more and more becoming a young persons city, somewhat like Bangalore.  God I love this city, wish I could stay here for ever.

      From the West of the Country I went all the way to the North East. The next city I lived in was Guahati. This city is the largest in the entire North Eastern Part of India. It has a very famous temple called the Kamakhya which has been filthly maintained. Also famous in this region is the Assam Silk Saree, which was exported by my Mother to all her relatives all over the country and abroad. We went to several places in Assam and the neighbouring states. Some of the places we went to were Cherapunji(Highest Rainfall in the world). We also went to the Kaziranga National park, famous for the One Horned Rhino. Generally an okay city if you can put up with the people who cannot speak English or Hindi properly and not to mention the fact, that they invariably mispronounce your name. An interesting superstition is that  you cannot leave Assam unless you have crossed the Bramhaputra at least seven times. If you do leave before you have done so, you are destined to come back. I don't think I want to go back to this place again simply because there is nothing to go back to or for.

        Does advertising have variations across the year?   was a question asked.  Of course. and it varies differently for different categories. As a broad and general statement for print, advertising peaks in October, with an immediate fall in November. For the rest of the year it is more or less at a stable level, except for a slight dip in Feb, April and July.   Of course there is also the fact that there will be individual variations for different categories... woollens, cars, computers for obvious reasons.  Then there are special events like the world cup, which would bring about huge swells in spends. This last world cup showed a monitored swell of 50% on print... amazing is the only word I can think of

      Some months ago, when I was with BCCL, (the publisher of The Times of India and he Economic Times), I had a conversation with CTO of the group Internet company, Times Internet Limited. Who asked me to put down some thoughts on how I see things on the internet shaping up. While I did put down those thoughts, I never actually sent it to him, the file was lying around till I came across it a couple of days back.  Here is a rewrite of what I initially penned down (typed up?).   A lot of rambling about nothing in particular.    The positioning of a product or service is more and more targeted to more and more specific audiences? Case in point are the BMW and Mercedes, both are from fine German engineering pedigree, both are premium luxury cars. However the buyers of the two will probably as different as two people can be. The former will be bought by a person who will drive the car himself and the latter probably by someone who has a chauffer (Yes, I know Mercedes also makes sports cars this is the general perception that I expressed here). Such a huge differentiation in mindset is what branding is all about. This trend is seen in media as well. The rise of niche publications in developed economies such as the US and UK is illustrative of this.   Any media would broadly undergo the distinct phases of consolidation in the growth phase and then  fragmentation once the medium matures. The internet is perhaps one medium which fragmented even before it matured. This is perhaps explained by the global reach of the media and the fact that ideas can be easily replicated across geographical & political boundaries; i.e. something that works in America, will almost certainly not work in India, simply because the maturity of the American market is of a different order of magnitude. To illustrate this point further the existence and flourishing of sites like epinions.com (in the American context) and the apparent non-starter of the Indian equivalent mouthshut.com which are sources of information.  Or price comparison sites like mySimon.com which as far as I know has no comparable Indian site.   With this brief background, it would be instrumental to see the whole internet game in a different perspective . The internet tends to promote the formation of groups of people with very specific interests. A sort of mother of all niche publications, which you can talk back to and whats more it talks back to you and allows you to communicate with your peer group.   While the Bennet philosophy has been to be an aggregator of audiences by subsidizing the price the audience pays to retrieve content and then retrieving profit from the purchasing those audiences. This can prove counter productive as far as the Internet goes, as the internet has people who are used to getting content for free and are likely to freeload. On the other hand the audience which does pay to retrieve the content would then be most prized and wanted by an advertiser, if nothing to prove non frivolousness of their transaction with us. The idea would be to convince the mass populace that information is of value. The easiest way to ensure that is to look for focused verticals in the information segment. The first one that comes to mind is economictimes.com or more accurately perhaps the work of ETIG.   The biggest problem that one can make out is how will people pay for it online. Multimodal payment mechansims are already in use by the Indiatimes family of websites. Virtual currency of some kind can perhaps be also created for this purpose.   What about the business we are in?    Content can take several forms, one of the forms could be that of blogs (such as the one you are reading right now). Blogs are the latest rage in America, now spreading to other parts of the world. Blogs are nothing but a personal running commentary on the world in general and sometimes specific to a topic.   Another form could be in the form of reviews. Reviews can be on any topic, from the palces to party & eat out in Delhi to where to find the best shoes in Chandini Chowk. Ineractivity which needs to be the cornerstone of such an offering. Such content may well be in the form of a blog.   Traditional content in the form of newspapers, TV, Radio will definitely migrate in one form or the other to the web. Evolution of devices like the Microsoft Tablet PC or the Handspring Treo are definitely a step in that direction.   In that respect standardisation under one name a la indiatimes.com is probably the biggest single mistake being undertaken by us and many others across the world. This conclusion is based on our initial premise that internet promotes the formation of specific focus groups. By definition these focus groups would be unlikey to turn to a general interest portal to get their kicks so to speak. The creation of multiple brands would be a better branding and strategic idea, having a ghoomnahai.com rather than having something like Indiatimes Travel. This gives an identity to the content and makes it more valued by its consumers.   The above, when seen in the overall context of evolution of media, is a perfectly logical sequence of events. Growing media consolidates, and then fragments. During the growth phase it is perfectly acceptable to have a single brand name, but the moment the medium matures (maybe in the context of the limited audience it gathers in the Indian scenario)   Show me the money!!!   Whether people will pay to read (& someday in the future see) such content is debatable. The likes of Al Ries would have us believe that advertising will never work on the internet (which is something I disagree with strongly). So what will happen? Will the internet become a subversive medium which will undermine modern society as we know it. A sort of a no mans land where no content will be paid for? products and services being the only ones able to draw any sort of revenue?   The Truth as the immortal words form X Files go is out there...  My personal suspicion is that heavily prized content a la NYT or WSJ will not only be paid for, but will also attract significant advertising revenues. For the rest, creation of strong niches will allow them to do the same   PS: Don't hesitate to comment...

      The Festival of Lights  This is one of the oldest Hindu festivals occuring in the month of Kartik, which commemorates the return of Rama to Ayodhya after an exile of 14 years. It also marks the beginning of the new year and is celebrated with the lighting of lamps. Diwali or Deepawali, literally 'an array of lamps', is the festival of lights and is celebrated on the darkest night of Kartik. It is perhaps the most important festival in India. Originally a Hindu festival, it has now crossed the bounds of religion and is celebrated by all in India with fervor and gaiety. This day is a public holiday all over India.  Twinkling oil lamps or diyas light up every home and firework displays are common all across the country. The goddess Lakshmi (consort of Vishnu), who is the symbol of wealth and prosperity, is also worshipped on this day. This festive occasion also marks the beginning of the Hindu new year and Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, the symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom, is also worshipped in most Hindu homes on this day.  Another view is that Deepawali is meant to celebrate the destruction of the arrogant tyrant Bali at the hands of Vishnu when the latter appeared in his Vamana (dwarf) avatar. The occasion of Deepawali sees the spring-cleaning and white-washing of houses; decorative designs or rangolis are painted on floors and walls. New clothes are bought and family members and relatives gather together to offer prayers, distribute sweets and to light up their homes.   Diwali is also perhaps the oldest festival still celebrated today and is mentioned in the Ramayana. The celebrations include the lighting of lamps and candles, and the bursting of crackers (fireworks). Friends and neighbours exchange special sweets. People buy new clothes and in fact, in certain communities, it is absolutely essential to wear new clothes on this day.  Diwali in India is equivalent to Christmas in the West. Therefore it is also the time when people get the festival bonus to their salaries. It marks the beginning of the new year for a large majority of Hindus, especially the trader community.  Preparations for the festival begin many days prior to Diwali. It is time for a thorough cleaning of the house, for the belief is that Lakshmi will enter clean and nicely decorated houses. The scientific reason is that the monsoon is a time for insects and fungus to breed.With the end of the monsoon, homes need to be cleaned and painted, and belongings aired and dried before the onset of winter. The festival itself extends over about a week even though the most important day is the new moonday.  In east Bihar and northern India, two days before Diwali is celebrated as Dhanteras in honour of Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods. He is believed to have emerged with a pot of amrita during the samudra manthan. People bathe early in the morning and observe a fast, which is broken only after sunset with sweetmeats, puri and other delicacies. On Dhanteras, new kitchen utensils are bought and kept at the place of worship. The buying of utensils, according to one theory, relates to the myth of Dhanvantari emerging from the ocean with a pot in his hand. Since he is also the physician of the gods, cleanliness and hygiene are essential to this festival. The day before Diwali is celebratedas Choti Diwali or 'small Diwali'. It is Diwali on a smaller scale, with fewer lights lit and fewer crackers burst.  The morning after Choti Diwali, the women of the house make beautiful, coloured rangoli in the doorway and courtyard. Tiny footprints made out of rice paste are a special feature of the rangolis made for Diwali. They signify the footprints of Lakshmi, as she enters the house. In Hindu homes, Diwali celebrations involve a ritual puja to Lakshmi and also to Rama in the evening. Songs in honour of the gods are sung and arati is performed. Oil or ghee diyas are also lit. The gods are offered kheel, batashe and khilone and various sweetmeats. After the puja, the diyas are placed in and around the house: in the doorway, near the Tulasi plant, the backyard, every room and the back and front gates. After this, crackers are burst, and people meet friends and neighbours to exchange good wishes and sweets. Since Diwali falls on the new moon night, lamps are lit to brighten this moonless night. According to a myth, Lakshmi will not enter a dark house. The lamps also welcome home the spirits of dead ancestors, who are believed to visit on this auspicious night. In addition, the light frightens away any evil spirit that might be wandering about near the house on this night. In Orissa, lamps are lit to light up the dark path that the spirits of ancestors take back to heaven. In modern times, ghee diyas have been replaced by wax candles and coloured electric bulbs. In many areas, there is a competition of sorts among neighbours as everyone tries to have the brightest lights. The origin of Diwali can be traced back to ancient India, when it was probably an important harvesting season. It was thus extremely important to the largely pastoral Vaishya community. Their granaries were full, and the weather was good, at the end of the long monsoon and before the arduous winter. It was therefore a good time to celebrate. The Vaishya community began their new year with this happy occassion, after paying their debts and clearing their ledgers. As the religion developed, various mythological stories and explanations were attributedto this festival to give it religious sanction.  However today, this historical explanation is all but lost among the many stories and folklore linked with the origin of the festival. According to the most popular one, Diwali is celebrated in honour of Rama, his consort Sita and brother Lakshmana, returning to their kingdom Ayodhya after a 14-year exile.To celebrate this event, people at Ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps. The illuminations also symbolise the removal of spiritual darkness and the onset of happiness and prosperity.    According to another belief, it is on this day that Lakshmi emerged from the ocean during the samudra manthan .Lakshmi Puja commemorates her birth and therefore forms a major part of Diwali celebrations. Being associated with the goddess of wealth and fortune, Diwali is specially important to the Vaishya   community. Most tradesmen close their old ledgers and dealings and start afresh with new ledgers after Diwali. This day, with its emphasis on money, is also considered lucky for gambling. Giving social sanction to a vice, a popular saying states that one who does not gamble on this day will beborn a donkey in his next birth. Casinos and local gambling houses do brisk business during the Diwali week. In most homes, people invite their friends and relatives over to play cards.   Another reason for the celebration of Diwali is that it marks the killing of the evil Narkasura at the hands of Krishna Naraka is believed to have abducted 16,000 women. Krishna killed him and rescued these women whom he later married. Naraka is the personification of hell and is believed to be the monsoon during which all activities come to a standstill.   Though Diwali is equally important in the south and the north, the celebrations are markedly different. In South India, the story widely associated with Diwali is that of Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu. According to a legend, Hiranyakshipu was an evil demon king. He was unjust and cruel to his people. However, he was almost invincible, having extracted a boon from Brahma that he would be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night. When his atrocities became unbearable, the gods sought Vishnu's help. Assuming his fifth incarnation of Narasimha, the man-lion,Vishnu killed Hiranyakshipu with his claws in the courtyard just before day break, hence steering clear of the boundaries of the boon. For this reason in the south, people light diyas in their houses on the day preceding Diwali. The next day begins early. First is the ritual bath, which begins with an oil massage of the hair and body. This is absolutely essential on this day. Its importance probably refers to cleaning oneself thoroughly after the monsoon months. After bathing, people receive new clothes and gifts from their elders, which they are expected to wear. The family then prays to Vishnu for its well-being and prosperity. After the prayers start the main celebrations which, as in the north, consist of bursting crackers and lighting candles.At day break, all celebrations end.People then visit friends and relatives and exchange sweets.   References to the word 'atishbaji' or'crackers' are found even in ancient literature. The bursting of crackers is today the most important and eagerly-awaited part of the Diwali celebrations. According to one belief, the sound that resounds throughout the universe makes all aware of the great homecoming of Rama. Another belief is that the crackers are an indication ofthe joy of the people living on the earth, making the gods aware of their plentiful state. Still another possible reason has a more scientific basis: the fumes produced by the crackers kill a lot of insects, found in plenty after the rains. The use of high-tech bomb crackers is fairly recent. At times, Diwali celebrations get ugly, especially in the metropolitan cities. In New Delhi, people start bursting crackers in the evening and this continues till the early hours ofthe morning. As a result, the city is engulfed in toxic fumes and smoke for almost 10 hours. Another problem with crackers is that their manufacture is usually unregulated. As a result, the manufacturing units are unsafe and the material used is inflammable and toxic.Every year, many units are destroyed inaccidental fires, resulting in the death of those employed there.   Kerala is probably the only state in India where even Hindus do not celebrate Diwali. The major festival there is Onam. In West Bengal, Kali Puja is performed on Diwali as it is believed that on this day Kali killed the wicked Raktavija. Being one of the main festivals of the trader community, markets are gaily decorated and lit up. Many safety measures and precautions are telecast on television and radio, especially for children. The fire departments are kept on the alert, and the municipal corporations of bigger cities also organise buckets and tankers of water at strategic locations. The second day after Diwali is celebrated as Bhai Duja when sisters apply tilak to their brothers and pray for their long and happy life. In all likelihood, this ritual was originally intended only for married women. Since they celebrated Diwali with their in-laws, this festival allowed them to come to their parents' home during this auspicious time. They got some time to meet the family and to rest after the hectic activity of the preceding week.And it gave their parents an opportunity to give them gifts, an opportunity they did not often get. Nowadays however, among many communities Bhai Duja is observed by both married and unmarried sisters.   urlLink http://webonautics.com/ethnicindia/festivals/diwali.html

      As a member of the Nokia planning team, I was party to the market Insight, that the device is becoming secondary to the whole process of communication... While this is worrying to Nokia Nokia is itself digging it's own grave...  How?   For years, Nokia phones were known for their simplicity and ease of use, and admittedly by the top execs of hte company that the proprietary interface on their hones had a lot to do with it... Howver the newer Nokias are using the Symbian Series 60 based OS. Which means that the interface is no longer the key distinguishing factor between the different brands of phones.  This coupled with the earlier insight would mean an ever weaking technological position which has been Nokia's marketing pitch in the past. The oft repeated statement in any marketing course as to Technology no longer being a differentiator, but a leveller, will be true for Nokia.   This  Wired  story on cracking of the Nokia N-Gage Games to be run on other Series 60 OS phones (Siemens), illustrates the point above.. It doesn't matter who you buy your phones from, modern applications will run on all of them

First there was the intersection of commerce on the edge, with scores of E:Bay auctions selling stuff in the make beleive worlds, then it was legitimised, with the game companies selling the stuff themselves. And now a judge in the real world rules on property in a vistual world. The intersection of the virtual and real worlds is complete   http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=internetNews&storyID=4022155   Online Gamer in China Sues, Wins Over Virtual Theft  Fri December 19, 2003 08:30 AM ET   BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese court has ordered an online video game company to return hard-won virtual property, including a make-believe stockpile of bio-chemical weapons, to a player whose game account was looted by a hacker.

      I thought this was a brilliant idea. Apparently the Google bar doesn't have the IE Control+Enter shortcut, and it trips up on urls like http://bloglines.com/myblogs, or part urls like download.com,  which are handled by the address bar.  So if someone at google fixes this, then one can be rid of the address bar and save some screen height in the Web Browser...

      Smite on...    urlLink God Considers Smiting Bible Pirates   Vatican City - God did not rule out smiting as a final measure against those who share his most famous work, the Bible, on the Internet. This marks the first time a deity has spoken on IT-related questions since Steve Jobs was temporarily Enlightened when touching the One True iMac some years ago.  Authorized Version? Citing misuse of His word, misquotation, and putting hardworking Bible printers out of work, God said he would now start hunting Bible pirating around the globe. 'I have to defend both my world-famous brand - the Bible and its distinctive likenesses - and the livelihood of those who create and distribute legal copies of it. Sure, they live not by bread alone, but website hits - someone else's website mind you - don't pay the bills for these folks.' Since large portions of the Bible are many centuries old, many people believe the work to be in the public domain. Not so, said God. 'Look, most copyright laws are based on something like the author's lifetime plus, let's say, 15 years. News flash: I'm still here.' ' I am a jealous God,' He said, 'but I am by no means unreasonable. If the person will stop distributing My copyrighted materials, there will be no further consequences. Like I've said before: hate pirating, love the pirate.'

      Decided to go  urlLink ego surfing  today. The term Chirag  urlLink throws back  this blog as the number 5 result. Not bad considering a  urlLink few months ago  I wouldn't even feature in the top ten.  A search for  urlLink Chirag Patnaik  now throws back this blog as the first one... Earlier it used to throw back one of the sites I'd done.  I also decided to have a look at who was  urlLink linking  to me... Pitifully few of course. And all of them from Comments I made somewhere or as part of some blog directory. I found    urlLink Recently Updated Indian Weblogs   He lists my Blog as...  urlLink Chirag   This is of course because of the long and unwieldy name of my blog. I'd realised this  urlLink earlier  of course. This just proves that I have to rebrand the blog.

      I'm considering a change of name...  Not my name.. the name of this blog...   Why?  It's a long story...  It goes back to my training as a marketeer... The Name ""A Blog Formerly Known as My Ramblings and Rants"" is far too long and from a branding perspectiv too complicated for anyone to refer. Not that anyone is refering to me... But, if someone were to refer to me, then that would be a real problem... A Branding nightmare... In fact I can hardly think of any popular blog which has such a long name.   So one needs a snappy one or two words for the blog...

      Roland Piquepaille in  urlLink Can You Pay U.S. Programmers at Overseas Salaries?     While cMarket has solved its immediate challenge, the implications of Jon's approach are potentially mind-bending. What if other companies begin taking the same approach -- offering Indian-style wages to American workers? On the positive side, we could begin to solve our job-creation problems. But on the negative side, America's standard of living would inevitably decline. There's only one way to find out for sure how it all might shake out, and that is for other executives to replicate Jon's experiment. The results could be quite interesting.    What is irritating about this is that America waves the flag of globalisation and when globalisation hits it, it goes screaming like a baby...   This is similar to the Visa regimes instituted by the West post World War II, trying to stop the influx of immigrants to maintain a better standard of living. When people world over figured that manufacturring in poorer countries is cheaper and businesses started moving manufacturing... America started screaming like a baby again about labor standards et al.   Conclusion of this Rant: If you want globalisation, allow free flo of labour. oops, you can't do that... otherwise Indians will take over your tech jobs... :D

      In an Economist feature  urlLink The World In 2004  A story on the Smart Dust revolution.  Alun Andersen, the Editor in Chief comments that for decades we have considered progress to be packing of more and more transistors on less and less silicon... Progress he argues is, things like the coming smart dust revolution. Smart dust or more accurately networked intelligenece to do  hazaar  things like do remote surveliiance for the military. or the use of RFID in supermarkets... enabling tracking of merchandise and a  fully automated staff less  supermakret...    For almost 40 years we have all been subscribing to a simple dogma about the growth of the information age: progress means making more and more computing power available at lower and lower prices. Back in 1965 Gordon Moore laid out his famous law that the number of components that could be squeezed on to a silicon chip would double every year or two. Now everybody can buy a laptop computer with the computing power that entire nations were aspiring to in the 1970s.  Moores law still has a long future. But in 2004 the belief that progress means packing in ever more computing power will be seen as far too narrow. Just arriving is another kind of information revolution, driven by the ability to manufacture billions of tiny, intelligent communicating sensors. Capable of organising themselves into networks, intelligent sensors will make up for their small brains by their immense numbers.

After weeks of what can only be termed as medieval torture i.e. pricks, boiling water, melted wax, electrocution, fingers bent thisway and that, I've recovered to a state which can be termed as normal as far as civilised humans go. I was finally able ride a bike (Yes the very same one, that was smashed in my unfortunate close acquaintance with a truck on the picturesque route to Mussorie) as of yesterday. It was limited to a an agonisingly short 10 minutes, but till more strength returns that will have to do. Physiotherapy will continue for the next few months, but if all goes well, I should be back in Delhi on the first of August and rejoin on the 2nd. Of course I have to hunt for a physiotherapist that suits my timings, but that is a small matter...  Before you say that should be the last joyride across the country, I'm thinking of driving back to Delhi on the bike... still have to convince a few people though... :)  Cheerio  Chirag

      What the...  urlLink You are Blogging my view...   The first time i heard the term Blogging, the first thing that came to mind was two men in Kerela on a Gogonet tree and one saying to the other, You are blogging my view. However, now this means something totally different to me. Blogging my view, now means that after reading your blog, my views are changing. How many of us are actually willing to let go of our opinions and accept new ones as we just read or heard something different from the views we so strongly believed in all this while. This is like writing a personal diary for everyone to read. I always thought about those who write a diary. I thought those were the people so desperate that someone  picks up their diary and reads it and saves them. It was a cry for help for those poor recluses and introverts. And then they made this rule, thou shall not read a personal diary. This obviously attracted more people to their diaries. So am i turning into a hopeless recluse?? I hope not. I do tend to drift away, but i think it gives you a chance to increase the scope of your discussion. Anyways...

      I can smell her now. The scent is reminiscent of a powder. Not baby powder, but a dry, mute aroma. A floral accent is present, similar to lilacs yet not as pungent. Before this, I only had one visual. The setting is always the same. Nighttime turns red to grey and yellow to white. She stands softly with her back to a wall of windows, covered mostly with draperies. It seems to be our bedroom. The visual of her is the strongest. Long, straight hair frames her oval face, giving her an intelligent air. The color black is an understatement, for her raven hair is so dark it is translucent. The contrast to her pale skin is remarkable. Though barely visible in the moonlight, her eyes burn with a comfortable evil. She is definitely my equal. Her attire is still a bit hazy. The Japanese aspects of my psyche scream out kimono, yet it could just be a simple shapeless dress she is wearing. The setting speaks that we are home for the night, or we could have just gotten home. There are many things I know, yet questions still remain. Her emotion toward me has two possibilities; she is either upset and concerned about something between us, or she has a joy in her heart boundless. The year I turn 22 is pivotal, but is it because we meet this year, or because we get married in that year?  These images and soothsay swirl in my mind as a mist, never to be grasped.

      The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen:



""Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer.""



One student replied:



""You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground. The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.""



This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately. The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.



The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics. To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.



For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use. On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:



""Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer.""



""Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.""



""But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqrroot (l / g).""



""Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.""



""If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.""



""But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'.""



The student was Niels Bohr, the only Dane to win the Nobel prize for Physics.

Conduit: con·duit (n.)  A means by which something is transmitted



The word of the day is used in the song Get Off by Bad Religion:



Lascivious, it's all that I can think of as I drag my feet, 

searching like a diogenes,

dangerous, the adjectives of the decade 

and of your alluring intricacies,

I can see your green-screen mentality 

and I can feel the sting of it's consequence,

and I know I shouldn't 

but it's too much to ignore, an emotion I deplore,

every time I look at you,

I just want do it,

I can clench my fist right through it

but I just want to get off



rectilinear, this direction we've been heading

never realizing we are on a runaway machine,

angular, the momentum that does turn us one

step further on our ladder,

one more turn toward the east,

I realize your green-screen mentality

and I know it is shared by many more,

I know it's quite impossible 

but I am damned to find a way to revolve the other way,

every time I scrutinize I just say ""screw it"",

we're on a ride down a blind  conduit  

and I just want to get off

The new  urlLink i815E  chipset from  urlLink Chipzilla  is a definite improvement over the i810 and i820 chipsets, or so says a  urlLink review from Sharky Extreme .  The 820 is obviously plagued by the high cost of RDRAM.  After significant price cuts, 128meg of RDRAM still costs  $350 !  The 810 was plagued by the onboard video, which was not upgradeable.  The 815 uses SDRAM yet also has an AGP slot for video upgradability.  The 815 also has a great affinity for onboard hardware, such as a network adapter, modem, or sound card.  Brand new systems can be purchased for cheap when built with this chipset.

She played  Perfect , and two other songs of which I have forgotten the titles.   urlLink Tara MacLean  was the reason why she played three songs.  After two, Keri began to walk off stage while the crowd was in an uproar. Tara ran over and practically shoved her back on stage.  My group gave her a standing O when she was done.  Following this display of musical excellence was a mockery: Amy Correia.  Described as having a 'unique voice' and 'eclectic songs', that is just one way of saying that she sucks.  Expect www.AmyCorreiaSucks.com before too long.   Starfishin'  was one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard.   Angels Collide  had good lyrics, but that is the only good thing I will ever have to say about that girl.  Knowing that Tara was coming on next, my group sat on the floor directly in front of the stage.  Two of the people I was with had seen Tara 4 times before, and I have heard great things about her shows.  She was just as vivacious, cute, and talented as they had all said.  We all got to sing along with   urlLink If You Could   because the crowd did it for her last time she was in the Detroit area and she loved it.  After Tara was Shannon McNally: more crap.   Fast Forward to the signing session.  I was too shy to talk to either Keri or Tara.

      Why do the Chinese use chopsticks?  They developed this custom because they didn't need anything resembling a knife and fork at the table. They cut up food into bite-sized pieces in the kitchen before serving it.  This stemmed from their belief that bringing meat to the table in any form resembling an animal was uncivilized and that it was inhospitable, anyway, to ask a guest to cut food while eating.

      Religion fired up in my life when I was baptized  some  form of Christian.  This much I know, not because the holy water scalded and scarred my body, but because the parents say so.  The next religious event would be going to a Baptist church with my father around the age of 11.  Deciding that religion was a good thing, he took me an hour before the main service to attend their form of sunday school.  The other kids were practically wearing suits and their best dresses, while I sat timidly in a tucked in tshirt.  Not having any of the materials the other children did and not being able to answer any of the questions asked, I soon disappeared from their mind.  Seems that my father assumed that I would be able to find the main service after sunday school.   Wrong.  Being timid enough from the uber-Christian children, I did not even venture out of the basement.  All of the children my age left, and many parents brought down children too young for the main service.   For the next hour, I stayed with 6 year olds coloring Bible scenes while eating graham crackers with milk.  Needless to say, I never wanted to return to church again.  Dragged by my aunt and grandmother, I attended a few Catholic services over the years.  The idea of  ""stand, sit, kneel, sit, pray, give money out of the infinite Catholic guilt""  process did not appeal to me.     By the age of 13, I realized there were other religions out there.  Not to say I was fully against Christianity, but my early experiences turned me from that faith in a hurry.  ""God created Man in his own image"" is reverse logic.   Man  created  God , especially in his own image.  Heaven and Hell are products of the human psyche being unable to comprehend unconciousness.  If the mind does not exist after death, how can we understand it?   Since that is impossible (sarcasm), Heaven and Hell were created as a true after life .  The afterlife is just like the mortal existence, yet a dichotomy is created.  If you were good, Heaven; Bad, Hell.  Is this not a very ingenious way to keep control over people during their entire life?  Then again, Karma is almost the same pattern.  Defining your next form through reincarntion based on Karma; it's the same sort of control.  Mankind has created religion as a way to answer that which cannot be answered.  Along the way, it has been tailored such that it can control the masses.    Studies on Buddhism and Hinduism were most appealing to me at a younger age.  Except for the aforementioned problems inherent with the karma and caste systems, the religions seem more logical.  There is Conservation of Matter and Conservation of Energy, so the idea of Conservation of Soul (life force, spirit) makes perfect sense to my logical mind.  Reincarnation, of some form, is the only conclusion to life that makes any sense.  Not even my mind can grasp the idea that we just  die .  Maybe I would enjoy life more knowing that.

      The problems setting up the  urlLink OpenBSD  server continue.  In an attempt to make use of old hardware, I tried to use a Pentium 60 machine.  It was the very first real computer I ever used.  The Bios came out when the idea of ""Plug and Play"" did not exist. All of the network cards I have are PnP.  There is a way to configure them manually, but that would require installing them into my current machine (which can definitely handle PnP), booting from a DOS disk, then running a few utilities.  Instead, I will probably just use my old K6 233 machine.  In contrast, once I get the hardware setup, I will have almost no trouble  urlLink configuring OpenBSD 2.7 as a cable NAT system .

      I worked  17.5  hours yesterday.  Took a half an hour break for dinner between jobs, and that was about it for rest.  In  urlLink Ann Arbor , most of the client machines could not connect to anything but the file server.  Knowing that the file server uses Appletalk as the protocol and TCP/IP is used for everything else, we narrowed down the list of possible problems.  Checking out the error logs on our servers showed stuff like this over and over and over:

 Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 

Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 141.211.148.76 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 

Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 10.0.1.5 from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 

Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPNAK on 10.0.1.5 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 

In basic terms, this is what was happening:  a system comes online and tries to DISCOVER the DHCP server, the server OFFERs a good IP from it's pool, the client REQUESTed a bad IP, and the server does Not AcKnowledge that request.  Then the cycle repeats.  This made no sense to all three of us working on the problem.   We tried restarting our DHCP server, we tried using a different server, etc etc.  FINALLY, Sat realized that someone had an  urlLink Apple AirPort  they wanted to hook up.   Searching the  urlLink Apple Tech Info Library , we found out that the AirPort acts as a DHCP server!  It was accepting all of the requests, and just giving out bad information!  Took that off the network, and everything returned to normal.  And it only took 8 hours to figure that out.

      I remember discussing the futility of regrowing neurons in my Neurobiology class first semester of my sophomore year.  It was decided that even if new cells could be transplanted and they would grow, the neural net would be so complex that the cells would never fully integrate themselves.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania has made an attempt at this experiment.  The  urlLink results  show that the neurons helped stroke victims regain motor control.  A very promising step indeed.

       urlLink Date Negotiations 

Cast: 

Bruce- Gerald 

Mark- Gerald

[Bruce is behind his desk, rubbing a credit or business card down his cheek.] 

Mark: [enters the office] Gerald. 



Bruce: Gerald! How are you, ya old skunk? 



Mark: Ah, how are you, ya old snake? 



[They begin shaking hands.] 



Bruce: Pretty good. [laughs] Good to see ya. Hey, how was your weekend? 



Mark: Aw, not too bad. A little too short, though; how was yours? 



Bruce: [laughs] Good, but a little short. 



[Both laugh.] 



Bruce: Business. 



Mark: Yeah. 



[They finally stop shaking and sit down--Bruce behind his desk and Mark in the chair in front of it.] 



Both: So. 



[Pause.] 



Mark: Well, I would now be willing to take a look at the proposal your client is making to my Lori. 



Bruce: On behalf of Dennis I'm, um, happy to show it to you. 



[He hands Mark one large index card, which Mark looks at.] 



Bruce: It's perfectly straightforward. 



Mark: A little too damn straightforward, Gerald; don't you think? 



Bruce: Uh...what do you mean? 



Mark: I'm sorry. I can in no way say that this represents the interests of my client. 



Bruce: It's a standard itinerary, Gerald--dinner, dancing, and [mumbles into his hand] intercourse. 



Mark: [abruptly] I beg your pardon? 



Bruce: [confident] Dinner, dancing, and intercourse. 



Mark: You mean a quick *hump*, don't you Gerald?! 



Bruce: I do not mean a quick hump, Gerald! Do not use that expression in this office! Children come in here! 



Mark: ""Dinner, dancing, and intercourse""--what do you think my client is, huh? A 90-dollar-an-evening hooker? 



Bruce: This is dinner at the *Plaza*, Gerald. 



Mark: Oh really?! So, she's a 120-dollar-an-evening hooker, is that it? 



Bruce: Well, at least a hooker comes across. [pause] I can't believe I said that. 



Mark: Gerald, do I sense that, uh, your client has certain feelings for my client? 



Bruce: My client makes 62,000 dollars a year. 



Mark: Ah. But, does your client have certain emotional interests towards my client. 



Bruce: He's got a really great car and a moustache. 



Mark: Gerald, does your client love my client? 



Bruce: Yes! No! He's not sure. [pause] Back off Gerald! 



Mark: I'll back off, but perhaps now you'd be willing to take a look at the proposal my client is making to your client. 



Bruce: [big sigh] 



[Mark opens up his briefcase and drops a folder containing a thick stack of papers onto the desk. Bruce opens the folder and flips through a few pages without really looking anything.] 



Bruce: You forgot one thing, Gerald. 



Mark: What's that? 



Bruce: The actual date of the wedding and the color of the bridesmaids' gowns!



Mark: Come off it Gerald. It's a standard 17-week dating commitment. All my client wants to do is to get to know your client. 



Bruce: Hey, all my client wants to do is get to know your client. 



Mark: In a completely different way! 



Bruce: I don't know, I think she's gotten to know quite a few clients. [Opens up desk drawer, ready to take out folders.] Let's just look at her roster of ex-boyfriends. 



Mark: Gerald, that's inadmissible and you know it! 



Bruce: [realizes his error and gently closes the drawer.] The Doobie Brothers?? 



[pause] 



Mark: All right, perhaps we were a little hasty with the 17-week dating commitment. Perhaps we can accommodate the obvious interests of your client a bit more. How about this: a six date schedule with possible sexual intercourse on date six. 



Bruce: Gerald, I'm no longer interested in this ""possible sexual intercourse"" you keep selling me on. Last time, it turned out to be a cheap handjob at the drive in. 



Mark: Your client ejaculated, Gerald! 



Bruce: Sadly. Very sadly. Let's just let sleeping dogs lie, shall we? [pause] Three date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on dates two and three. 



Mark: Uh uh. Five date schedule, guaranteed sexual intercourse on date five. Now that's a one-way ticket to Loveland, Gerald. That's a heap of good lovin'. That's a Love-o-rama. That's a Love Fest. That's a Love Woodstock, for God's sake. Come back to me. 



[Long pause. Bruce has a goofy smile on his face, in thought.] 



Bruce: Gerald. [calling him in closer] Gerry. [closer] Ger. . .Guh. Why don't we forget the guaranteed sexual intercourse clause. 



Mark: Okay. 



Bruce: Why don't we let nature take it's course. 



Mark: Fine! 



Bruce: You know the good old fashioned way? 



Mark: [eagerly] Yeah, okay. 



Bruce: A one date schedule with a guarantee that your client will consume 27-ounces of gin on that evening. 



Mark: Come off it Gerald! That's panty peeler and you know it. 



Bruce: Call it what you will, it's a tool of the trade. 



Mark: Sorry Gerald. C'mon, she only weighs 105 pounds, for God's sake. 



Bruce: I believe she weighs 111 pounds, Gerald. 



Mark: In shoes! [pause] All right. I can't see letting her drink more than 8-ounces of gin. 



Bruce: Jeez, I think she can drink, uh, 14-ounces of gin. 



Mark: Maybe 10, maybe 10. 



Bruce: I think she could scarf down 12-ounces of gin. 



Mark: 11-ounces of gin. 



Bruce: 12-ounces of gin on an empty stomach. 



Mark: 11 on an empty stomach. 



Bruce: [taps his fingers on the desk, calculating in his head.] 111. . .Done! 



Mark: Okay. 



[Both getting up] 



Mark: I'll have my secretary pick up the contracts Monday. 



[They lean over and kiss each other on the cheek. Mark turns to leave and then they do a subtle double take.]

[Bruce is singing his son to sleep.]



Bruce: [singing] Picnic time for teddy bears / Those little teddy bears are having a wonderful time tonight.



[Bruce tries to leave because Scott appears to be asleep. As soon as Bruce tries this, Scott wakes up and looks to Bruce as if he's not at all tired.]



Bruce: [singing] See them gaily play about / They love to sing and shout.



[Bruce tries to leave again, same thing happens.]



Bruce: [singing] They haven't got any cares [Gets up to leave but this time continues to sing] But it's six o' clock / Their mummies and daddies will take them home to bed / Because they're tired little teddy bears. [talking] Good night. [Flips light off.] 



Scott: Dad?



Bruce: [light back on, still at doorway] Uh, yes?



Scott: Were all the bears there?



Bruce: Yes. All the bears there ever there was were there. Goodnight.



Scott: Dad? How--how come the picnic ended at six o' clock? If it was so good? I mean, it's--it's not even dark at six.



Bruce: Uh, all the bears were tired from, um..., frolicking.



Scott: Oh.



Bruce: Frolicking's very tiring, son. Goodnight



Scott: Okay, what they--what they eat?



Bruce: Oh. Well. The teddy bears ate buttons and...felt.



Scott: Ewww!



Bruce: Oh, no no! That's teddy bear food.



Scott: Oh.



Bruce: It's like hot dogs. Mmm. 



Scott: Okay, yeah. Were you even there? What?

Scott: Well, then--then how do you know?



Bruce: A guy at work told me.



Scott: Who?



Bruce: Hank.



Scott: Hank who?



Bruce: You don't know him.



Scott: Maybe I should call this Hank.



Bruce: No no. I don't think that would be a good idea, son.

Bruce: Now go to sleep.



Scott: Dad, I can't sleep trying to piece together this sloppy narrative.



Bruce: [sighs] Why don't you try, uh, counting sheep?



Scott: [cries/whines] Ahh!!



Bruce: What? What, guy?



Scott: How can you make me think of all those slaughtered sheep bloated in the sun? [cries]



Bruce: They're not slaughtered sheep, son. They're live ones bounding over your head.



Scott: What? I thought they were dead! You didn't tell me they were alive. Dad, I was up all night tagging their toes. [cries]



[Dave enters]



Dave: What is going on around here?



Scott: [still crying] Maa! Uh uh!



[Dave goes over to Scott, who in turn clings onto Dave's arm.]



Dave: Oh, oh. There, there. What is it?



Scott: Yeah, yeah. Dad told me this ""Teddy Bears' Picnic"" story and it sounds like utter bullshit to me.



Dave: There, there. Just remember that your father loves you and I love you even more. . .



Scott: Okay.



Dave: . . . and if you ever use that kind of language in this house again, I'm gonna wash your mouth out with soup.



Scott: Oh.



Bruce: Uh, I think that's soap, dear.



Dave: Don't ever contradict me in front of the boy. There, there, little hero, you get some sleep. Okay.



Scott: Okay, `night mom.



Dave: `Night.



Bruce: `Night, Tiger.



[Bruce approaches Scott to give him a kiss, but Scott puts his fists up in self-defense. Bruce kisses the fists. Bruce and Dave leave, they turn out the light, and Scott is alone.]



Scott: Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Mmm, soup.



[Cut to parents' bedroom.]



Bruce: Goodnight.



Dave: So, this Teddy Bears' Picnic story isn't true?



Bruce: Um, no. Not exactly.



Dave: Well, if you weren't helping out at the picnic, where were you last weekend? Hmm?



Bruce: You think I'm having an affair, don't you?!



Dave: [shocked] An affair?!! Oh my God!



Bruce: Um, you didn't think that?



Dave: [shakes his head no.]



Bruce: Oh. Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. I was out with a few of the guys from work. . .and a few goblins. . .and, uh, it started raining gumdrops. . .so uh. . .we happened into this wizard's tavern, and uh. . .I'm gonna be honest, we had a little too much dew to drink. So, uh. . .I thought I shouldn't drive.



Dave: Well, you did the right thing by not driving, but you should have called.



Bruce: Well, you know, it's the darndest thing, honey, um, the wizard's leaf wouldn't dial out.



Dave: Well, fine. But next time you should just try harder to get a hold of me.



Bruce: You're right, sweetie.



Dave: Alright.



Bruce: Goodnight. [turns out the nightstand's light.]



Dave: Who's Doris?



Bruce: [Turns light back on. Frantically:] Doris. Doris, Doris, uh, Doris.



Dave: Doris. A woman named Doris came to the house the other day and said she'd been meeting you for some time in sleazy motel rooms and that she was carrying your child and wanted to know what you were going to do about it, and I was just wonder who she was.



Bruce: Uh, I could see why you'd be curious.



Dave: Yes, well she did pique my interest, yes.



Bruce: Honey? She's a goat. She's a magical goat. And, she delights on playing tricks on us mere mortals.



Dave: I am so. . .relieved!



[Bruce also relieved. Both laugh.]



Dave: I feel like such an idiot.



Bruce: Don't feel like an idiot. No no, it's natural.



Dave: Oh, can you forgive me?



Bruce: I do, I do.



Dave: Oh, I should be jealous. [cuddles into covers]



Bruce: [turns out light] Yes you should.

      Clean is good, a mantra I have recently accepted.  This is mostly because through a laborious process which failed,  I lost my main partition .  The last incarnation of this system had partitions setup for Windows 98, Windows 2000, linux, a linux swap file and a FAT32 data partition (MP3s, thanks).  No matter how hard I tried, I could only boot into linux using a boot disk.  The Windows 2000 bootloader was not smart enough to load it.  Originally, I had  urlLink Red Hat 6.2 installed .  Feeling adventurous, I decided to install  urlLink CAEN linux  instead.  Who wouldn't want to run a distribution of linux created at their  urlLink own university ?!  For some odd reason, CAEN tried to use my network card at IRQ 0, which just does not work.  Also, since it is based on Red Hat 6.1, it did not properly recognize my GeForce video card.  Screw that, time to go back to Red Hat 6.2.   Oops, now that is trying to set my NIC to IRQ 0!   Screw that, lets go with  urlLink linux Mandrake .  The NIC was properly configured for IRQ 5, but it still wouldn't see my gateway.  I figured I could work on that later.  I got x windows working just fine, but by this point I figured I should get some work done.  Since all of my course hyperlinks were stored in Windows 2000, a quick reboot should get me going.   Reboot, walk away, come back to linux.  WTF?  Reboot, wait for my Windows 2000 bootloader menu to show.  Linux.  WTF?!   Reboot, look for any promising signs, boot into linux.  Try to mount my windows partition, get weird errors about bad disklabels and superblocks.  At this point, I knew what the outcome was.  My C drive got fried by Linux Mandrake because it was not smart enough to ask me where I wanted the boot information.  All of my documents from the past year, all my conversations, anything:  GONE .  Oh well, nothing I can do about it now....

      I know, I know...  this sporatic posting has  got  to stop.  I apologize.  Life has been very hectic lately, and I am just now getting used to the new semester.  Let's start from the most recent and work our way back...   Today was my first discussion section for CS 280 (C++ programming).  We went over the mysteries that are FTP, telnet, pico, and the g++ compiler.  Aside to that obvious sarcasm, the GSI (graduate student instructor (read: TA)) is quite foreign, and impossible to understand.  No longer will my prescence be necessary at that class.  During 280 lecture yesterday, I sat beside an overly stressed sorority girl.  The stereotype was in full effect, as she complained about how she had no time for programming since it was rush week and she had to party.  She also complained about the complexity of UNIX.  All she has to do was type three well-documented commands.  We are even allowed to use Visual C++ for most of the work!   Dumb blonde.   Two nights ago was scary.  The main server at The Michigan Daily went down.  All of the stories, production templates, everything.  Couldn't do anything to the server remotely, so I dragged my ass to StudPub.  Logged in at the console, and it turns out that all 4 of the data hard drives had crashed, destroyed their disklabels, and could not be accessed with AppleTalk.  After an hour of scratching my head as to what would cause the 4 data drives to crash all at once, yet keep the operating system drive intact, we decided to blame the weather.  ""Lightning"", we told all of the frustrated Daily staff.  Oddly enough, even without disklabels, the drives randomly came back up for an hour.  Down for 2 more hours, and now they have been up for 48.  Stability, not my concern.  Other than that, life has been boring....    Everyone needs to  urlLink tell me what makes their life interesting .

      Heh, I was just kidding, folks.   I did end up going to see Phish!

The lot crowd before the show was a bit melancholy, which was most definitely caused by the combination of planes roaring directly overhead every two minutes and the slight amount of rain.  Once everyone got inside, the mood was dramatically lifted, mostly because we were no longer cold and wet.  Here is the setlist:

Set I (0:53): Come On Baby Lets Go Downtown > Moma Dance, Frankenstein, Halley's Comet > Fee, Stash 



Set II (1:12): Birds of a Feather, Tweezer> NICU > Scent of a Mule, Fast Enough for You, Piper > Character Zer0 



Encore (0:09): Sleeping Monkey > Tweezer Reprise



Short first set, eh?  The reason: GLOWSTICKS.  People throwing hundreds of glow sticks all over the arena is a cool effect in the dark smoke-saturated environment.  People throwing glow sticks at  the stage , at   the band   -- not good.  We probably missed out on two songs because of it.  Most people knew something was wrong at intermission.  The arena crowd created a cacophony after the second set which was probably the ONLY reason why Phish did an encore.  The crowd really did not deserve it.  Thus, we got two songs, and the band bowed and ran off stage.  Dodging glowsticks.  Again.  Bastard phans.

       Michigan State (3-3) at (16) Michigan (5-2) 



Player to Watch: Ryan Van Dyke, QB, Michigan State. Starter has struggled since returning from injury and even got replaced last week by Jeff Smoker.  

Breakdown:

 Both sides are issuing the standard spin about this being a tough rivalry game, but reality says it's a mismatch. Despite their 3-0 start, the Spartans clearly are in a rebuilding year following a 10-2 campaign in 1999. The only consistency is RB T.J. Duckett, the nation's No. 5 rusher (148.3 yards). Michigan exploded in a 58-0 win last week and will likely go right at the Spartans' wobbly defensive front with powerful RB Anthony Thomas.

       The world, and especially the US, is going to encounter an energy shortage in the next 30 years.  The oil supply is steady now, but it is estimated that with our current rate of extraction, that supply will be nil in 25 years.  Coal reserves can stretch out for 5 years beyond that, and then our fossil fuels are gone.  As of 1998, 89% of the energy of the world was produced from fossil fuels.  Alternative energy sources are less efficient, such as nuclear energy.  Future energy sources need to be developed.   urlLink Fusion  would be an excellent development, since power output is almost 10 times the power input.

      Pro-lifers in Britain are attempting to stop the separation of Siamese twins joined at the lower abdomen.  The procedure would save the life of one, while the other could not be saved.  The pro-lifers are vying to have the House of Lords rule on this matter since it is along the lines of abortion.  Their idea is that the House of Lords would either postpone or oppose the seperation.



Here is the kicker:  if the two are not seperated, they will both die within months.

Here is the broad generalization: Pro-lifers are complete idiots.

Specific hardware will be supported to get the x86 platform started, then full support may roll in if the idea takes off.

      Well, I think it is time to change my screen name (nick, handle, whatever you want to call it).  When I first got online, I used Felix.  That was mostly on the non-elite BBSs I frequented.  By high school, I started to use Takashi000.  If you have ever seen the movie  urlLink Akira , then you might remember Takashi as a character.   If you really remember the movie,  you might realize that Takashi26 would have been a better handle.  Nah, I like zeros.  

I believe it was in my first year of college that I decided a new name was needed.  No longer a big fan of Akira, Takashi000 was retired.  The first couple years of college were some of my least stable.  During this time period, I was quite morbid, and was completely convinced that I would be dead at a young age.  There was little hope.  The only concept of hope that I had was mythical, the idea of being a  urlLink phoenix .  That is the reason behind  urlLink Phoenix26x , my current handle.

That would be the third handle I have grown out of, so maybe I should pick something a bit more permanent.  Here are the possibilities:

MikeBibik: this one shouldn't be hard to figure out.

BibikDotOrg:  why not advertise for the site at the same time?

ChaosTerminal:  ...or just advertise the weblog.

      Not sure who is the original source of this:



so i'm waiting for the bus at cc little to go to north campus, and this girl walks up and stands next to me.  she's hot, by the way, and she's wearing a tri-delt sweatshirt.  after i was done thinking about how hot she was, i realize that she's an idiot because i'm wearing my winter fucking coat and am still cold and she's standing outside waiting for a bus in nothing more than a sweatshirt.  well, i've probably never been more right about anything in my life.



so right when the bus is coming up she sees one of her friends - had to be in a sorority if not tridelt due to the black fuck me pants, black down north face jacket, black wool hat and black framed glasses.  she also had black sandals on - yes, it was still cold outside.



as i get on the bus, they sit down in front of me, which was nice, because remember, they're both hot.  i'm not really paying attention to anything in particular, mostly because i'm contemplating how much it sucks that i'm going to north campus to sit in a class that i don't really need to be going to anyway, and so it catches me off guard a bit when i realize what the two girls in front of me are talking about.  hard boiled eggs.  it was just weird, that's all.



so anyway, i'm listening to the girl in black bitch about how her roommate will hard boil all of the eggs in the fridge to use on salads at once, and then keep them in the egg carton so that when she wants to use an egg (god only know for what purpose - it certainly wasn't to eat, unless she was planning on inducing vomiting afterwards) she cracks it open only to find that it's hard boiled and not a raw egg. well this is where it starts to get entertaining for all of the engineers on the bus.  now, it was just about 1 o'clock when i was on the bus, so there were a lot of non-engineering students just headed back to bursley after class, and thus only about half the bus was keeping an eye on the hot chicks - you see, engineers don't come across girls much, and when we encounter hot chicks we tend to just kind of stare at them.  well, anyway, remember the girl in black was talking about all of the hard boiled eggs.



so, the girl in the sweatshirt says, rather loudly, ""well, why don't you just unboil them?""



now, remember we on the bus that are paying attention are all engineers. i had already figured out that this girl was an idiot (sweatshirt in the cold), but the rest of the engineers must have been too engrossed staring at her to think much of that, so when she says the line about unboiling the eggs, one engineer just about chokes on his jimmy john's while the others stares turn from awe to amazement and shock at her stupidity - it really was funny.



so the girl in black actually notices everyone staring at them at this point, and gets a little bit freaked out.  she says something like, ""what the fuck are you talking about, you can't unboil an egg"", to which dumb sweatshirt girl says, sure you can, my boyfriend told me all about it.



and i'll spare you the story, but it basically involved a practical joke that her boyfriend had played on her which resulted in her cracking a raw egg on her forehead.  by now, most of the people on the bus, even the non-engineers, are trying to contain their laughter.  i really can't, and i'm pretty much laughing out loud, but only the girl in black notices.



and she gets pissed - either at the sweatshirt girl, or at everyone laughing at her, i don't know - and starts YELLING, ""YOU CANT UNBOIL AN EGG"".  each time she yells it, sweatshirt girl starts getting bitchier and bitchier, yelling ""YES YOU CAN"".  finally, the dude in front of them turns around, looks sweatshirt girl in the eye and says ""you're crazy, you can't unboil an egg"". this shut her up at least, and the north face girl looks really happy at being validated - i think that during the whole argument she wasn't really sure herself that you couldn't unboil an egg.



so the sweatshirt girl just sits there for a minute, and then i can hear her mumbling under her breath something about ""chemicals"" and ""her boyfriend"" and she finally tells the northface girl that ""i'm sure you can somehow.""



northface girl of course just yells ""NO YOU CANT"".



by now, most of the engineers have slapped their foreheads and left their hands there, making a pretty funny scene - a whole bunch of dorky guys holding their hands to their heads while shaking them.



the girls talked about it for a while, and finally sweatshirt girl agreed that maybe you couldn't unboil an egg.  by now, the rest of the bus was talking about it, and from the front, we could all hear a flaming homosexual music major ask, in the loudest, gayest voice possible, ""Well, why *couldn't* you unboil an egg"", which caused me and just about everyone else to go into convulsions of laughter all over again.



by now, we had just about reached the stop, but stupid sweatshirt girl wasn't done yet.  she had started talking about how it was tuesday, and tomorrow was wednesday, and how we should change the calendar so that wednesday was the first day in the week and tuesday was the last, so that we would have the weekend in the middle of the week.



one of the engineers to our right had had enough i guess, and interrupted the two girls to inform them that if you put the weekend in the middle of the week, it would no longer be a weekend, it would be a weekmiddle.



neither girl understood it, and while he tried to explain for a bit, we all ended up getting off the bus before he had a chance to finish.

      Server upgrade complete!   The downtime wasn't so much for the extra 128 megs of RAM I installed, but more so that I can undo the overclocking...   Unix is much better at making use of a CPU than any form of Windows.  That Celeron 366 overclocked to 550MHz without problem on my old Windows 2000 machine.  During certain activities (mostly compiling), the computer (the same CPU now in my OpenBSD machine) would completely freeze.  This is not normal for Unix, so it must be the overclocking.

      The MP3 of the week has been updated.   urlLink Radiohead  released Kid A awhile ago, and it is a radical departure from the glory that is OK Computer.  Most of the songs grow on you, and I absolutely adore Optimistic.  The background vocals are melodic (and blend in perfectly with the simplistic guitar riffs), the main vocals are crisp, and there are enough hooks for everyone to love this song.  Not sure if this is radio-single-style quality, but it's quality nonetheless.  The lyrics have a perfect sense of sardonicism (yes, that is a word, go look it up, MOFO): 

 You can try the best you can

If you try the best you can

The best you can is good enough



This one's optimistic

This one went to market

This one just came out of the swamp

This one dropped a payload

      *SPANKED*   That is all there is to it.  Java final: spank.  Anatomy lab practical final: spank.  Neither of those exams went well, to say the least.   To make matters worse, the exams were set back to back:  Java final from 6-8pm, Anatomy lab final from 8-9pm.  The fact that the exams were 2 miles apart also caused a problem.  Add in the ""snow"" factor, the ""buses running late"" factor, and the ""my ride never showed up"" factor, and you have a cold, late Mikey.  I got to the lab practical just in time to start, without instruction.

      Having taken both a chordate anatomy class and an evolution class, this  urlLink article about an aquatic origin for humans  is quite intriguing.  Many of the adaptations shown by humans could be explained by certain aspects of an aquatic life.   The examples they give are not in depth enough to be convincing though.  This is just an article from a popular scientific magazine, and thus hardcore facts are avoided.  Also, it seems that the researchers are jumping to conclusions.  Yes, brain size and posture could be explained by this theory.  The main problem is that there are no other concrete facts that support this idea, such as a fossil record that shows evolution of these traits.

The new switch I got for my home network has already proved quite valuable, since transfer rates from my main production computer to my main server have increased from 5kbps to 42kbps.

      I've never been called a racist in my life, nor do I believe that I ever will.  When most people (especially men) are accused of being racist, they vehemently exclaim ""But some of my friends are black!"".  This may very well be true, but well assured that these 'black' friends act more 'stereotypically white' than the average.  I could almost say that I fall into this category.  Two friends of mine are just these sort of friends.  They have normal midwestern accents, wear t-shirts and average clothes you can find at the mall, etc etc.  Lastly, they have extreme public courtesy.  The public editor of the Chicago Tribune comments on the  urlLink lack of public courtesy  that some blacks have.  By the way, the editor is also black.  Does agreeing make me racist?

      I have no shame.  A few days ago I was looking for emulators on the web.  Finding a free Gameboy emulator proved almost impossible but I found a  urlLink Java Gameboy emulator .  Other than the lack of sounds, it is quite amazing.  I started Java programming (Java, Java servlets, and JavaServer Pages) recently, and the code to the emulator is understandable and clean.  As with most applets, don't try to run it on a Mac; it crashed IE 5.  The next discovery was the No$ (no cash) emulator.  With a name like No$, I am thinking free.  Five minutes into playing  Pokemon , the game quits and the program pops up with ""Pay us or you only get 5 minutes of playing at a time!!"".  Bastards.  Didn't I say I had no shame?  Well, yes, the only reason I wanted these emulators was to play Pokemon!  And play Pokemon I have!  I have put over 8 hours into Pokemon Silver in the past three days.  Does that mean I found a free emulator?  No, but I found a way to circumvent the No$ 5 minute rule...   Want a copy?  Come and get  urlLink it .

      Sick of spending most of my days just trying to find something to keep myself busy, I have decided to get some certification.  The first one will be  A+ , which most people think is a joke.   I figure I can get this certification with no training.  It covers basic hardware skills and DOS/Windows skills.  The hardware portion is as basic as ""Is this a power supply or a video card?"", but gets a bit more difficult with ""Is this RAM chip ECC or not?"".  What they call the Operating Systems Technology is just an overview of DOS/NT/Win9x/Win2K.  The OS exam covers basic Windows installation, troubleshooting and networking.  If I can't pass these tests, my legacy as a failure will go down in history.  If (once) I pass these exams, I will try my hand at something actually difficult.  Too bad there isn't a generic sysadmin exam.  There are exams for  urlLink linux sysadmin ,  Redhat sysadmin ,  urlLink Solaris sysadmin , and  urlLink AIX sysadmin .  If there was a BSD sysadmin cert, I would be all over it.

Basically, it is a complete rewrite of the Content Management System (CMS) I wrote for the  urlLink daily .  Now that I know the error of my ways from the first attempt at a CMS, I can do this one right.  So far, I have added (or plan on adding) a completely modular approach, automatic archiving, web-based configuration, a database backend and most importantly, the ability to create sites that have infinite depth.  Each template can reference a previous template, which could itself reference a previous template and so on.  Try writing a database for that one!  Other than that, life is good.

       Two months ago, I would never have thought that a significant portion of my computing time would involve Linux.         This semester, I am in EECS 481, Software Engineering.  I would give you a link to the class homepage, but the professor decided the content isn't for the common man -- it's password protected.  The core of this class is a single, monolithic (redundant repetition, I know) project.  The only constrain to this project is that it must concern a certain  domain .  The domain for this semester is the software process.  How self-referential is that?  Our software project must be about the software process.   

        We decided on a project manager with some automatic environment creation scripts.  Basically, the manager of a software company would use a Windows front end to manage his developers.  He could see what projects they are working on, what experience they have, etc etc.  Whenever he had a new project, he could select which developers should work on it and click a single button to setup a few necessities:  A web site, mailing list and CVS repository for the new project.  

        We needed a server-class operating system for the backend.  Though I know  urlLink OpenBSD  fairly well (going on 2 years admin experience), we chose  urlLink RedHat  7.2.  The decision was made simply because of the greater install base of RedHat.

        When I first started developing the backend scripts (I did it since no one else had the experience to correctly setup Majordomo and Apache, let alone know how to write Perl scripts), I used VMWare on my main machine.  VMWare made my life much easier as I tested these scripts.  Before I would do a new install of the scripts, I would backup my entire RedHat machine with two clicks.  If the install went haywire (which it often did), restoration was as simple.  

        Enter my new laptop: a used IBM Thinkpad 600.  Ever since I got this thing, I have taken it to every class and worked on code while the professors droned on and on.  I got the idea of working on the scripts while in class.  RedHat 7.2 installed beautifully.  Slowly but surely, my Windows XP partition is touched less and less.  The laptop boots into Linux by default.  

        Linux  and open source software has improved dramatically since I last used it (RedHat 6.2 days).  AbiWord reads most Word files cleanly (other than tables, bleh!),  urlLink Mozilla  0.9.9 is now my default browser EVERYWHERE (the Macs at work, my Windows XP machines, this laptop), and I just found a new love:   urlLink Ximian Red Carpet .  Think  urlLink Windows Update  on steroids.  I will be trying  urlLink Ximian Desktop  next.

      Eric and I had planned on playing street hockey with the same bunch of people we played with a couple weeks ago.  Some of them were still learning to skate; none of them had played street hockey for more than a couple months.  Needless to say, the games were fun and low on competition.  Today, none of them could make it.  Knowing that lots of people play at Elbel field, we headed down there.  About 8 guys were playing and there was an 9 year old boy trying to keep up with them.  Seeing such a group, we knew they couldn't have been too good.  Turns out, they were all better than the two of us, but we held our own.    After an hour and a half of playing, a few more guys showed up.   Slowly as these people started to sub in, Eric and I noticed how outclassed we were.  I thought they were just good amateurs with a cocky attitude.  When we finally left, Eric told me he found out that they were on the UMich hockey team!  Man.  No wonder.

      Personally, I always thought that vegetarian food was more healthy for you.  In a browsing spree, I ended up at the  urlLink Jimmy John's website .  I used to get their #6 (basic veggie sub) all of the time, but switched to the #5 (the Vito, an Italian sub comprised of salami, capicola, provolone, veggies and vinaigrette) after my first taste.  The site has  urlLink nutritional information .  The Vito weighs in at 24 grams of fat and 562 calories.  The veggie weighs in at 35 (!) grams of fat and 671 calories.  When I first started eating at Jimmy John's my freshman year (4 years ago, sigh), I always got the Gargantuan.  46 grams of fat and 892 calories.  Ooops.

      Did you know that you still need to pay parking meters after 10 PM?  Did you know that there are handicapped meters?  (I bet you know where I am going with this one).   Laura is sick and last night she asked if I could bring her some sorbet.  I parked on South University (in Ann Arbor) about three blocks from her apartment and right between an ice cream shop (Stucchi's) and a store (Village Corner).  I got the sorbet, dropped it off, visited for about 15 minutes and went back to my car.  In my door handle I was greeted with a $75 fine!  I am pretty sure I will be able to appeal this ticket.      I am still not sure if you have to pay a meter after 10 PM.  Most university meters are only checked until 6 PM.  I had no idea that handicap-only meters exist.  Since I didn't think I had to put money in the meter, I didn't see that this was a handicap-only meter.  I was getting ice cream for my sick girlfriend!

      Point of the following story:  We gambled and won!  Eric's sister decided to go to  urlLink Joe Vision  last night to see game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals.  Since Eric is leaving for Alaska on the 18th, we have been trying to hang out as much as possible.  The two of us decided to meet his sister and her friends down in Detroit.    Since we left just after I got home from work, I was starving.  We both thought of what quick and cheap restaurants were on the way from Ann Arbor to downtown Detroit.  One restaurant shone above the rest:   urlLink White Castle !  There is a White Castle at Telegraph road just off 96.  Obviously, you can't go to White Castle without getting burgers, but we also caved into the novelty of Chicken Rings.  They are tasty and easy to eat; the perfect food.  While there, this fairly large female bus driver asked us both ""How do you keep your feet so purdy?"".  I said something about how my feet weren't 'purdy' and that they were also burnt from being out in the sun all day yesterday.  She didn't care, as she continued to comment on our toes and heels.  Foot fetish in a White Castle, I know.  Back to food:  between the two of us, we had 8 burgers, 9 chicken rings, 2 orders of fries and a couple Cokes.  During the first period at the Joe, my stomach was in a raging battle against said food items.  I won, if only for the fact that I didn't have to poop at JLA.  That is a decisive win against White Castle.

       urlLink Neverwinter Nights  is out!  A friend, his girlfriend and my roommate all bought copies on the first day.  Thankfully, I got to play for about an hour yesterday.  The single player mode is a bit dry so far, but I only played for an hour!  I really can't decide whether or not I like it.  The interface is a bit clunky due to the Sims-esque circular navigation.  If you haven't played either of these games, the navigation starts by clicking on an object (right-clicking for NWN).  The click brings up circular icons in a circular pattern around whatever you clicked.  You are then required to click on one of these circular icons.  If there is more than one such level of navigation, a new set of circular icons in a circular pattern pops up.  If not, then your selection has been made.  Belanger and I discussed the merits of this game and decided that multiplayer games with a DM on an isolated server are where this game will shine.  People are going to start making modules soon, too.  This could be the next Counterstrike.

      I saved myself $100 yesterday!  I bought a fairly nice Sony CD Walkman last summer (the previous version of  urlLink this model ).  I only used it probably 30 times since I bought it, mostly working out.  Back in the day, I would bring a CD player wherever I would do homework, but now I just bring my  urlLink laptop .  Well, sometime last semester, something in my CD player broke.  The lid would never stay shut.  If the lid is open, the player automatically turns off.  Yesterday, I probably killed two hours just looking at new CD players.  I finally decided on  urlLink this one  since it is a Sony, thin, and can play MP3s.  Yes, it's in girly blue, but I like girly blue!  (You should see some of the shirts I have...)  Before ordering it, I thought I might as well try to fix my old player.  How could it hurt?  I was going to buy a new one anyway!  I ripped it open, moved the lever a bit and it worked!   Well, by ""worked"" I mean the lid would stay shut.  I got all excited and decided to go work out, just to try it out.  After changing, getting a Nalgene bottle ready and downing some Creatine (you think I am joking?), I tossed some batteries into the old player.  Nothing.  Press play.  Nothing.  Sigh.  I ripped it open *again*.  I couldn't see anything wrong, though I did have to disconnect a cable to reset the lever.  I reseated said cable.  Nothing.  Just then, I noticed a little piece of plastic sitting in my lap.  How it stayed there for the fifteen minutes between when I first opened the player to when I noticed it is beyond me.  I figured where it went (another lever that pushed down a little button when the lid is closed) and wham.  I was off to the  urlLink CCRB  listening to  urlLink Trail of Dead .

      In my opinion, once you hit the age of 22, no one will still consider you young.  21 is an odd age:  you are old enough for almost all responsibilities but society does not consider you an adult.

      Lets see, what's been going on lately?  I scheduled the second portion of the A+ certification exam for this Thursday.  If the difficulty of this exam is on par with the first portion, I have already passed.  All of the interns are going to a  urlLink Tigers  game on Tuesday.  I have only been to a handful of baseball games in my life and this will be the first time I have gone to the new stadium.  Honestly, I hope all the money that is being dumped into Detroit does some good.  Compuware is moving their headquarters down there, we have the casinos now, Ford Field will be the new home of the Lions, etc etc.  Time will tell, as will the census.  If the population reaches a million again, that is a good sign.  I saw UFC 38 last night.  The only fight that was truly interesting was Genki Sudo versus Leigh Remedios.  Sudo came out looking like a WWE wrestler, so I already hated him.  When the fight started, he was throwing out taunts like candy and just acting cocky.  Turns out, this ploy worked as it threw off Remedios' game.  Sudo finished him with a lightning fast rear naked choke.  Now I like this guy.  Speaking of UFCs and Detroit, Chris was telling me that the one that was held in Detroit was a complete disgrace.  To allow the fights in Michigan, there could be no punching.  How is that mixed martial arts?  The pay-per-view numbers were *halved* for the next UFC.  Good job, Detroit.  The tag line for UFC 38 was ""Brawl in the Hall"", as it was held at Royal Albert Hall in the UK.  Chris and Marty couldn't remember the tag line for the Detroit UFC, so we decided it had to be ""Motor City Mayhem"", ""Motown Showdown"" or ""D-town Beatdown"".  So cheesy.

      One of my coworkers is really into home automation.  He showed me how his entire house is controllable through the web.  It even keeps logs of all the activity.  A lot of geeks are worried about the uptime of their servers.  His house has a whole list of uptimes such as ""Living Room Lamp 1, In the OFF state for 1 day, 13 hours, 5 minutes and 36 seconds"".  He can tell when the garage door is open, who has called and how long they talked, the temperature of each room, etc etc.  He uses  urlLink HomeSeer  software and a lot of products from  urlLink smarthome.com .  You know those damned X10 pop-under ads?  Well, it turns out that X10 is actually a protocol for home automation and that no one that does home automation really buys from the official X10 company.  Back to that ""entire house is controllable through the web"" bit:  Combine an always-on DSL connection and a weak password, and someone can hack your house.  Tip:  don't use your first name as your username with a single repeating character as your password.

      So, I get home from work a bit late today, 5 PM to be more exact.  As I pull into my parking lot, I hear a cacophony of high pitched squeals and beeps.  Annoyed though intrigued, the sounds seemed familiar.  As I get closer to my apartment door, I realize almost simultaneously that the sound is coming from my apartment and is the sound of six smoke detectors going off at once.  Can someone cautiously bust into an apartment?  I did just that.  No smoke.  IRON ON AN IRONING BOARD!  But it was cool and non-burning.  RUN UPSTAIRS.  Nothing.   W h a t  t h e  h e l l . . .    The usual way to get the damned smoke detectors is to find the one that is being set off and then flagellate a large cloth object (usually a bath towel) in its general direction.  No smoke means no amount of flagellating will help.  By this point, I am almost completely deaf.  The sound is so much, I cannot even tell where it is coming from any more.  All of the detectors are on the same circuit, so I started disconnecting them one by one.  Being just under 6 foot tall, the detectors were *just* out of my reach to be grabbed down and disconnected.  Damn it all, I just started ripping them down cautiously (again, if possible).  I got 5 of them (the sixth was already disconnected) but the sound continued!  I was so deaf that I couldn't tell if the ones I had just removed and tossed to the floor were still sounding or if there was a hidden detector, or if the sound was all in my head.  After an eternity of going nuts, the detectors timed out and the silence was deafening.  None of my roommates were home, there was no smoke, it made no sense.  Thinking of how great my luck is, I knew that if I left all of the detectors disconnected there *would* be a fire.  Replaced the two downstairs:  no problem.  Replaced the one in the upstairs hall: no problem.  Replaced the ones in the other bedrooms:  no problem.  Replace the one in my bedroom:  FUCKING DEAFENING CACOPHONY GETS REVENGE.  You know that little confused path that people comicly take when they don't know where to go or what to do?   You know, rush off in one direction, quickly reverse, spin around in a circle then just charge forward?  I did just that, in my own room, in my own apartment.  Ripped down the detector in my room and the sound stopped.  All of this chaos because a single smoke detector isn't working properly.  I still can't hear right.

      <Crazy Waiter Story> So, after Chris' amateur martial arts fight in Rochester Hills on Saturday, we all went to Red Robin in Novi.  We knew our waiter had lost it when our first impression of him was seeing him dance to YMCA with extreme fervor.  Over the course of the night, he asked us if we had ever been to Philadelpia (all because the Rocky theme song was being played), asked us if we liked the Shining (all because of a picture of Jack Nicholson with glowing eyes), explained the entire story of the Shining (even though we all knew it), forgot Lauras drink, forgot Lauras food, then gave us an extra pitcher of beer to make up for his insanity.  His excuse was that he had been working since 10 AM (and it was already midnight).  My reasoning states that he is always like that in a ploy to get better tips. </Crazy Waiter Story>

      ""If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be?"":    I honestly wish I was more naturally outgoing.  I may seem outgoing, but it's not always me.  When I was younger, I was very shy.  With my friends in my neighborhood, I was a normal kid.  In school, I was pretty damned quiet.  Every year in elementary school, I was in some sort of accelerated program.  Not with other kids, but they would make something up for me.  When I was in first grade, I had to go to one of the second grade classrooms for reading.  Stuff like that.  That definitely made me an outcast.  I had very few friends at school, and until I started playing sports during recess I rarely hung out with anyone.  I was still very quiet until 9th grade.  At that point, I more or less forced myself to be outgoing.  I started cracking jokes, being a loudmouth, being very opinionated, etc etc.  It still feels like a show, a farce, to this day.

      Geek humor (in reference to anti-gravity), curtesy of  urlLink Slashdot :   Since we all know that   1. Cats always land on their feet, and  2. A buttered slice of bread will undoubtedly land on the carpet butter side down,   we could strap said buttered slice of bread onto the cats back, then drop the whole thing to the floor.  Retort:  This fails both under quantum physics and general relativity.  Under the quantum physics interperetation, since both the cat's feet and the buttered toast are equally likely to land on the floor, the cat-toast enters a superposition where both cat and toast are simultaneously on the floor until it is observed, at which point a radioactive particle decays, and the cat is skinned in a number simultaneous, equally likely, yet distinct ways.  Relativity predicts that the intense attraction to the floor will, in fact, bend space-time in such a way that the floor actually is in contact with both the cat and the toast. If the cat is of the black variety, then it will thus cross its own path, generate a singularity, and vanish in a puff of logic.  The debate continues, as attempts at experimental verification have thus far failed. Dr. Kibble at Princeton's IAS said ""Look, have YOU ever tried to hold a cat still and strap some friggin' TOAST to its back?""

      I was only awake for about 50 minutes today, my 22nd birthday, when I got my first present!  At about 7:55 AM, I heard my car alarm go off.  That could mean only one thing, I was getting towed again!  I scampered down there, barefoot, just as the tow truck guy was putting braces on my rear wheels.  Seems that my forged permit was fading so fast that it was quite obvious.  Just yesterday I noticed that the text was a lot closer to yellow than to the expected red.  Long story short, the tow truck guy remembered how nice I was the last time he tried to tow me, so he let me go with just a $40 fee.  Come to think about it, I only paid $120 this entire summer to park in my lot ($80 fee a month ago, $40 fee today).  Not bad for four months of parking!

      Here is a little perl script that I wrote for work over the past couple days.  Basically, our E10K (named CAD) had a hardware failure and the Oracle database struggled to come back up afterward.  The senior UNIX admin was having trouble getting a Korn shell script to correctly report whether or not a process was running.  Originally, this perl script would just grep the process list for one specific process and then shoot off an email to a list of admins.  Now, it will look for any number of processes and send emails to any number of specified admins.  The comments should explain it all.  The only line that might need some explanation is this one:  foreach $recipient_number (@{$process_recipient_bridge[$process]}) { process_recipient_bridge is an array of arrays (or list of lists, if you will).  I want to get access to one of those internal lists.  To get a single element in an array of arrays, you would use $array[index1][index2].  To get a whole array out, you still use $array[index1], but then you have to cast that as an array:  @{$array[index1]}.  If you want to run this on a BSD, OS X or Linux system, make sure that you change ""ps -ef"" to ""ps -ax"" and ""mailx"" to just ""mail"".

      So, my favorite field is finally starting to produce fruit:  urlLink I Can See  ( urlLink Wired cover ).  Ever since I read all 5 pages of this article this morning, my mind has been awhirl.    First, the techology behind this is amazing.  The camera, not amazing.  The computers, not amazing.  The software, not amazing.  The neural implant, bingo.  If you have read the article, you will know that this implant sits directly atop the visual cortex.  The resolution is not that high, but it does allow the user to perceive objects.    Second, I am rethinking my future plans again.  Cybernetics is now, the proof is here!  This is just the beginning, this is just what the public knows.  I am sure that many of my dreams will be realized by the end of my lifetime (which should hopefully coincide with the end of this century).  Why should I limit myself to basic computer support work my entire life?  Why should I try to get an MBA and join the management track before I am 28?  Technology and cybernetics are two true loves.  Repairing vision (of this fashion) is simple in comparision to what is possible!  Maybe I should have stuck with my plan to become a biomedical engineer.  Too bad UMich didn't offer a BME undergraduate degree when I was applying.  Third, I really want to watch  urlLink Ghost in the Shell  again.

One of these formalities is usually in the form of the question ""What are you majoring in?"", asked after they find out I am in college.  My answer, ""Biology and computer science."", is always countered with one of two responses:  ::Hesitation, look of confusion::  ""Really...  That's different.""  -OR-

      A new project I would like to work on:    A simple BSD or Linux boot disk that contains a few utilities for testing for a hacked box.  Initially, the system administrator would boot off this floppy and run the initialization utilitity.  It would take an MD5 hash of all the files in specific directories (such as /etc, /bin, /sbin and /usr/bin) and store the results in a text file.  Later on, the system administrator could boot off this floppy again and run the comparison utility.  It would take another MD5 hash of all the files and compare the results.  Doing this in BSD would be easier for me because I have access to many BSD machines.  Doing it in Linux would make it much more widely supported.  Can the stock Linux kernel mount FFS file systems?  I know OpenBSD can mount Ext2 file systems.  Red Hat now uses Ext3 by default, so it would only work with older RH systems.  Hopefully I will be able to create a boot disk that would work with most any unix system.  This project could also use  urlLink Tripwire  or a  urlLink pre-made system disk .  Or maybe I will just do it all from scratch just to be a jerk.

      Wow, I'll be damned.  You know how I said there were two main singers for that crappy opening band, Cuda?  Well, turns out, the guy with the better voice is Gar Wood from the Hot Snakes.  I just thought the regular bassist was taking some time off, so the guy from the Cudas joined them.  It's completely the other way around.  No wonder I was so confused, and no wonder there was such conflict, and no wonder his voice is that much better.

      Laura and I went to the Hot Snakes show last night at the Magic Stick.  Neither of us had been there, so we had a bit of difficultly parking.  We found the actual place just fine, but we had to settle for street parking a couple blocks away.    To summarize the Magic Stick:  Hellhole.  The main room isn't too bad, though a bit run down.  The pool tables are all 7 footers, and are thus worthless.  The bartender was quite the jerk, but what else would I expect?  The bathroom was, by far, the worst of it all.  Laura was so disgusted by the her bathroom that she wouldn't even describe it.  The mens room had two stalls and two urinals, yet no stall doors or seats even.  The funniest part was there was just a random roll of toliet paper sitting toward the middle of the room.  Who would use that?  No door, no seat, just a random roll sitting in the filth of many punks?  I will pass.  Strike one.  I knew there were supposed to be two opening bands, but I figured they would start playing soon after the doors opened.  We got there at 7:30 PM, the doors didn't open until 8 PM, yet we waited and waited and waited.... The first band (Red Hot Legends) finally started at 9:30 PM!  They sucked.  Musically, not bad.  Their vocalist, on the other hand, was so horrid that we couldn't understand a single lyric.  Strike two.  A good 40 minutes after the first band screeched to a halt, the second band (The Cudas) got on stage.  Musically, pretty basic without flourish, melodical but plodding.  The band had two main singers and a female backup singer/keyboardist.  You could just tell the two guys were vying for top spot in the band.  The guy who called the shots was a cheesy chach, the other guy had a much better voice.  Gotta love band conflict.  Their lyrics though, simply pathetic.  Strike three.  Finally, praise god, the Hot Snakes got on stage sometime after 11 PM.  I am not even sure when they started, my eyes were watering because I was so over tired.  Without any build up or chatting with the audience, they launched into I Hate the Kids.  I was a bit unsure of their quality live at first, but then I think their sound engineer tweaked something.  The sound was very faithful to the albums, but with pure raw energy.  They also played 10th Planet, Automatic Midnight, If Credit Matters I'll Take Credit, Light Up The Stars, No Hands, Our Work Fills The Pews, Past Lives, Gar Forgets His Insulin, XOX, Who Died, Suicide Invoice and Ben Gurion (wow, I remembered almost all of them).    Laura and I actually left during their show because I was so tired.  Hopefully I didn't miss much.  Luckily, I got to hear my favorite three songs (I Hate The Kids, If Credit's What Matters I'll Take Credit and Suicide Invoice).  It's so hard to rock out when you have to get up before 6 AM the next day.  The show was amazing, thus all strikes are taken back.

      And I thought acid was bad:  Laura's older sister Carolyn was housesitting/catsitting for some friends these past two weeks.  15 days of this, which was supposed to end yesterday.   Since the couple was supposed to be back last night, Carolyn went home.   She got a phone call around 11 PM from the FIRE MARSHALL.     It seems that the dryer caught on fire and burned up half of the basement.  They found her cell phone number on a note upstairs and called her.   Luckily the fire caused a water pipe to rupture, helping quench the flames.  She was okay, the cats were okay, no one was hurt.   More luck for that family.

      And I thought wasps were bad:  Laura works at the School of Public Health as a lab technician.  The lab she works in deals with air purity/polution.  The air and water samples they collect are stored in generic glass bottles.  To insure that these bottles are free from impurities, they are washed in acid, baked in acid then cleaned with various other techniques.    Just the other day, Laura was doing the usual routine of cleaning bottles when she accidentally dropped a bottle of acid into a sink.  The acid bottle was open since she was using it, thus acid splashed up and into her EYE.  She immediately used the eye wash, which I believe saved her.  Though she could see just fine after it happened, she decided to go to the ER just to be sure.  They flushed both eyes with a liter of saline each then examined the damage.  Just a small amount of corneal abrasion which healed quickly.  Thank god.

      The things a boy will do for internet access:   As most of you know, I am back at my parents house for two weeks this summer.  During this time, my only home net access will be dial up.  This would be bearable if I could actually make a connection!  I dial up my umich account and the connection will die within 20 minutes (usually after only 1 minute).    I called up Ameritech and they said it could be a problem with the line, or it could be internal wiring.  If the wiring was the case, then they would charge us just to come look at the problem.  He suggested that I connect a modem directly into the interface on the outside of the house.  Problem, my computer is in the basement.  Luckily, I am sometimes smart.    I found a phone cord long enough so that I could run it from the external interface, through the bathroom window and then *down* the laundry chute into the basement.  Unluckily, the external interface is behind a  urlLink rose of sharon  bush (Hibiscus syriacus).  Guess what likes to hang out around these bushes?  Wasps!

 Test the composition of the soil. 

 Add soil amendments to correct soil composition. 

 Add fertilizer and till 6 inches of the soil. 

 Level soil to a 1-2 degree grade. 

 Water for 2 weeks to allow weed seeds to germinate. 

 Remove weeds with Round Up. 

 Lightly rake top of soil. 

 Spread seed equally in two passes, the second at 90 degrees to the first. 

 Lightly rake the fresh seed. 

 Lightly roll the fresh seed. 

 Apply a light layer of mulch. 

 Water lightly (5-10 minutes) twice daily until lawn height is ½ inch. 

 Water deeper (15-20 minutes) once daily until lawn height is 3 inches. 

 Mow lawn to 2 inches with a sharp-bladed bagging mower.

      As much as I hate using this page as a place to rant, sometimes it has to be done.  The first assignment for my senior design project is due this Wednesday.  Basically, it is a presentation that explains the requirements of the project.  In order to do the presentation, we need to have a good idea of what the project will be.  Since our project was pretty open-ended, that required meeting with the client (in this case, the biomedical engineering professor).  Professors are busy people, and thus he could not meet with us until today.  He found an opening in his schedule and emailed us at 11:15 AM saying he was free from noon until 2 PM.  None of my other group members could make it, which is understandable given the short notice.  Thus, I had to meet with the professor by myself, while still extremely sick.  Luckily, I was able to be partially coherent and not spray snot all over his office walls.  Since I am poor and car-less, I took the bus from north campus back to central campus after the meeting.  There was one kid standing up in front of my seat while myself and the kid next to me were trying to get off the bus.  I let the kid next to me get up first, then I started to stand up.  When the first kid got up, the guy that was standing slid back and was directly in front of me.  Without even looking above me, I stood up.  I stood up directly into the guys elbow.  Crack, right on top of my head.  Now my leg and my head hurts.

      I finally got my MDE project:   We run some large image processing tasks that run over many processors.  We've developed our own code to distribute computations over several Unix systems, but it's really out of date.  In particular, we need to take advantage of the compute power in Linux clusters.  We have our own small cluster and we would liek to exploit the capabilities of the large cluster in the Center for Parallel Computing.  One of my students provided the following request.  I think this would make a great senior design project with real applicability in the commercial world....   How about a tool set for running background C code or MatLab jobs.  Kind of like the launch program, but for use on our local Athlons.  A script would detect what machines are idle and launch jobs in a joblist serially.  Alternatively, and even better, they could get an account at the Center for Parallel Computing for the Athlon clusters.  These clusters use SMP parallel computing additions to the C language.  For independent C processes like our tracking, it would not be that hard to write scripts that modify the C code so it can run on these Athlon clusters, and maybe even automatically launch it and give feedback in the process.  So users can run independent C code on these systems without having to learn the SMP additions or details about the parallel cluster.  Automatic transfer of files without interactive authentication and big/little endian compensation may pose some challenges.  This is a seriously under-developed project description.  We are going to have a meeting with the professor that suggested this project to get some solid details.  The cool part about this professor is that he works in the biomedical engineering department.  My bio degree will make it easier to get in his head.

      I have another project to add to my list.  Hopefully I will finish one of these this semester.  For the sake of argument, I will define the ""lifespan"" of an operating system to be from the day it is released to the public (either for purchase or for download) to the time *two* new versions of the operating system have come out.  An example would be  urlLink OpenBSD 2.9 .  It was released on June 1st of 2001.  Since  urlLink OpenBSD 3.1  (the second version past 2.9) came out on May 19th of 2002, the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9 was 06/01/2001 to 05/19/2002.  Over the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9, there were 27 different patches.  That might not seem like much, but that is over two patches a month.  For a company that has many servers, that could be a lot of patching.  Likewise, the current version of OpenBSD (3.1) has 14 patches already.  That version had only been available for under three months when the last patch was issued.  Now that I have that cleared up, time for the actual project:  An OpenBSD version of  urlLink Windows Update .  Since no self-respecting BSD admin would go to a website for their patches, BSDUpdate would be a command-line tool.  It would check the current state of your system, verify which patches were needed, and download them.  The tool can then install the patches and restart services as/if necessary.  The tool could also be put in ""automatic mode"" and placed into a cron job for completely seamless updating.  This is actually a very easy project (but also time consuming).  Nevertheless, I will be damned if I ever finish it.

      School started this week, which is the main reason why my post frequency has dropped to near-zero.  My classes for this term include Operating Systems, Molecular Biology and the Major Design Experience.    Operating Systems is not as cool as I thought it would be.  Instead of getting an overview of the 1.9 million topics involved with operating systems, we are only learning threads and file systems.  So disappointing.  Molecular has been good so far, which is surprising.  By now, I thought I would be horrifically sick of anything biology related.  I talked to someone new in class for the first time in practically three years, so that might help.  And finally, the Major Design Experience (MDE):  8 credits for a single project.  We were given something like 30 projects to choose from.  We got to pick our top three, then the professors will put us into groups.  My choices were:  Writing a set of UNIX/Linux tools to ease administration of a network that includes UNIX, Linux, Windows and Mac workstations.  Add an extension to the university LDAP server so that email groups can have their list archived or sent as a digest version.  Rebuild the EECS website, both the design and the database backend.  I don't care which one I get, they should all be fairly easy.  Time consuming, but easy.  Once I get into the swing of things, I am sure I will be back to posting (almost) everyday.  I don't even have a desk in my room yet, so it might be awhile.

      You know you are a software engineering geek when:    An every day problem comes along, and instead of just trying to solve it immediately, you have to plan for it.  ""Well, we first have to figure out what the real problem is before we can solve it.""  Then you have a requirements phase, trying to figure out what will need to be done to solve the problem.  Then you have a design phase, trying to come up with a good way to solve the problem.  Then you actually do it.  I need to spend more time with biology and less with computer science.

      Sprint PCS sucks.  There is a very good reason that the greeting on my phone has been Sprint POS ever since I got it.  Let's go over what happened to me this month:  I moved from Ann Arbor to Livonia back to Ann Arbor.  I changed my address on the Sprint PCS site about a week after I moved to the new Ann Arbor apartment.  The changes just wouldn't stick.  I would change the address, save the changes, reload and the old address would be back.  I tried for about 3 days to get it to stick, no luck.  Eventually, I just couldn't log into the website.  I make all of my payments online, so this was going to be a problem when September 7th rolled around (my billing date).  Obviously, that day blew past.  I couldn't log into the website for a couple weeks and my bill was overdue.  They didn't turn my phone off for a couple weeks, so I thought I was set.  No so much.  They turned it off yesterday.  I STILL can't get into the website.  This morning, I called their customer service number.  I had to PAY $3 to get my address changed over the phone.  That is strike 1.  My new apartment is in the basement of a house.  My cellular reception is extremely spotty and random.  Sprint PCS rarely works in university buildings.  My job, classes and main study area are all in such buildings.  Thus, my cell phone only works when I am walking to and from my destinations.  What cellular provider should I go with?

      As I  urlLink mentioned previously , I signed up for  urlLink EMusic  recently.  In the first few days, I downloaded upwards of 1.8 GIG of music.  If they are going to offer unlimited downloads, I'm going to take advantage.  I've pulled down 49 albums so far.  Some of the highlights:  

Adult. 

Apples In Stereo 

Belle And Sebastian 

Built To Spill 

Etta James 

Pavement 

Sahara Hotnights 

The Hives  

More will be coming.  Maybe I should keep a list of all my MP3s since that list is growing so incredibly fast.  But anyway, for only $9.95/month (for 12 months) or $14.95/month (for 3 months),  urlLink EMusic  is a great deal if your tastes are broader than mainstream.

      Just this morning I told myself that I would stop spending money.  In the past month, I've bought a new digital camera, work out shoes, a bunch of work out clothes, some regular clothes (but no more blue shirts because Leah says I have too many.  Not possible!), and a subscription to  urlLink EMusic .  I spent a lot of money going out, especially on food.  So, I said no more.  Then, I got a gift certificate in the mail for $15 at Express Men.  Jamie and I went today and I said I was only going to spend enough to use up the gift cert.  Not so much.  I ended up spending $80 there and then $40 at Fields buying some new cologne (Pleasures for Men).  I promise, no more.

      Hmm, speaking of working out, I never explained how accident-prone I've been over the past few weeks.  I cut myself twice, once on a bagel when I was in a  hurry and once when chopping up peppers and I wasn't paying attention.  The pepper cut, which is on my left thumb, was so deep that I probably needed stitches.  I'm a dumb boy, so I just put a butterfly bandage on to seal it up.  When working out at the beginning of spring break last week, I was walking on my hands (a relic from my pre-wrestling work outs) and stretched out my ACL in my right knee when I landed.  Being a dumb boy, I played racquetball with Joe later that evening.  I was attempting a spinning return when I realized there was no way I could land and put that much pressure on my right knee.  I stopped midway but my racquet kept going.  I smashed myself in the left eye.  I should have taken pictures right when it happened, but here are a couple pictures from over a week after it happened:   Normal coloration   Photoshopped coloration to show bruise beneath the eye

      Crazy dream #2:  Just a few days ago I had a dream that involved moving down to Georgia.  Since I don't know anyone down there, I had to find housing by myself.  All of the apartments were full or something so I ended up subletting a room in a mansion.  The details of the mansion itself were fuzzy but there definitely was a pond in the back with some odd stones surrounding the perimeter.  (It reminded me of a  urlLink Mandelbrot set , now that I think of it.  Do you dream in fractals?  Thought not.)  The owner of the mansion and (what could only be) his young daughter showed me to a room.  They said there was only one problem, the bed had been in the pond earlier.  Eh, whatever, I took the room anyway.    

I fell asleep (in the dream) and woke up with two leech-like beings on my left hand.  I immediately started to swat at them, trying to get them off.  The owner and daughter (who must have been watching me sleep) yelled at me to stop and that these leeches would keep sucking until either they filled with blood or died.  On closer inspection, the leeches had these coiled bodies that could expand and hold a LOT of blood.  I had to get to the hospital, so I called Eric (who knows why he was in Georgia).  He picked me up in some weird Dodge Neon-SUV hybrid (which can be explained by the fact that I fell asleep reading Motor Trend) and we tried to ask for directions to the nearest hospital.  Everyone would give us directions, but different directions.  Just as we got on the highway, I woke up.  My entire left arm was completely asleep which explains the leech bit.

      Crazy dream #1:  Just after Leah and I started dating, I had a dream that I was MCing a talent show.  It was held in downtown Detroit in a dingy, 70's-styled theater.  I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up on stage and was told to MC the entire affair.  I didn't know who was supposed to be in the show so I just talked to the crowd and made a game out of it.  Rob Shereda was in the audience and I was under the impression that he was supposed to be the MC but decided to let me run it.  After introducing the first act, I hopped down from the stage into the crowd.  Everyone seemed to be dressed as if it was the 70's, but in that updated-yet-still-retro style.  Leah was there and just as I was about to talk to her, I woke up.

The  urlLink really big   urlLink black server  in that gallery is the old database server that I replaced last weekend.  Other than work, I hung out with Leah as much as possible.  We went up to State for a night and that would have been a prime candidate for picture taking, but I hadn't met 90% of those people yet.

      Homework can wait.  Tonight was the  urlLink Sarah Slean  concert!  While I was checking out  urlLink other concerts , I saw that she would be playing at  urlLink The Ark  tonight.  I knew that Jenn was a fan, so we decided to go.  I had only heard a couple of her songs quite a while ago, but I figured it would be good to go to a concert anyway.  I'm damn glad I went.  Not only was it a good time with Jenn (and seeing Beth wasn't half bad), but the concert itself was so good it was inspiring.    I really had no idea what to expect.  When a gorgeous redhead (though fake, I think) took the stage with a vivacious and humorous stage presence, I knew this was going to be good.  She has a good command over the piano, ranging from full-yet-harsh wailing to soft and melodic.  Her voice takes a bit of getting used to, but she has some power when she wants to use it.  Her lyrics were a bit obtuse for a first time listener, but that will surely correct itself over time.  Interestingly enough, her guitarist was actually the most talented person on stage.  He played four different instruments total, two electrics, one acoustic and one that could only be described as an electric tweleve-string ukulele.  With the help of at least 12 different pedals, he added a depth to the music that would have left the piano naked without.  All in all, a pretty kick ass show.  Jenn bought her newest CD and quickly sent me MP3s of all the songs when she got home.  This is definitely going into my permanent rotation.

      This has been a crazy week.  The craziest part is trying to organize one of my interviews.  When they initially contacted me a couple of weeks ago, they asked for 8 possible interview dates.  I gave them 8 and then realized a few days later that one of those dates was the same as my AI final!  Murphy's Law in full effect, they chose that day.  I emailed my contact back immediately and asked if it could be rescheduled to any of the other days.  The best she could do was to push it back a day, to April 25th.  I have finals on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th and then commencement is on the 26th.  Bad timing, eh?  So, here is a rough estimation of my schedule for those three days:  

April 24th   

	10:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Final 

	Between 3 PM and 6 PM: Fly out of DTW 

	Between 6 PM and 9 PM: Arrive 

	Afterward: Crash at hotel  

April 25th  

	6 AM: Wake up, get ready, find office 

	8:30 AM: Interview, interview, interview 

	Between 9 PM and Midnight: Fly out  

April 26th  

	Between 5 AM and 8 AM: Arrive at DTW 

	9:15 AM: Commencement  



I can't believe I am taking the redeye from an interview to catch commencement.

      I've fallen in love with two older games lately:   urlLink Gran Turismo 3  and  urlLink chess .  Yeah, chess is just a wee bit older.  

Basically, Joe tossed GT3 into the PS2 earlier this week for the first time since we've owned it.  He has only played the rally races (since he hates all of the races on pavement).  Matt and him scrapped for awhile and I tossed my hat into the ring.  I was under the impression that to correctly navigate a turn you had to be turning the whole time.  In rally, this couldn't be farther from the truth.  You turn well before the actual bend in the road and then power slide through almost every one.  I got smoked in those first few races.  After they had left, I gave the course a few more runs.  I just barely beat the course on ""Easy"" mode *then* I figured out turning.  Each run saw my times improving after each iteration.  Eventually, I was beating the CPU car by 10 seconds in ""Hard"" mode.  That is when I got hooked.  

GT3 is an extremely deep game.  Even the simplistic ""Arcade"" mode has 30+ tracks and too many cars for me to count.  The simulation mode has a depth I haven't quite fathomed yet.  You start off with a meager amount of money and no cars.  My first car had a whopping 116 HP to start, which was pretty depressing since Zig had a car that was pushing 1048 HP.  You can customize your car, earn driving licenses (that allow you to enter the more difficult races), and obviously race.  I've just started, but I'm sure I am going to be hooked.  

On to chess.  For some reason, Zig decided that all of his programming buddies should have a contest.  He will write a basic GUI that allows people to plug-in two chess engines and have them go at it.  I doubt I will participate (since writing a chess engine would take hundreds of hours, at least), but that got chess on our minds.  After dinner (a Tuesday night tradition with the guys), Chris and I ran to the chess store at Briarwood and picked up a chess clock.  We went back to my apartment and played four games:  Chris versus Matt, Matt versus Joe, Joe versus myself and then Joe versus Chris.  None of the games ended with a checkmate since we were playing with the clock.  The first game gave 15 minutes per person then we pulled that down to 10 minutes per game when Joe was playing.  I just didn't pay attention to the clock and I ran out of time with the game probably only half way through.  Speed chess just isn't my thing, but I at least didn't lose in less than 20 minutes total.  

Hopefully I stick with both of these games.

      Jamie, Joe and I hung out yesterday.  We just absolutely had to enjoy the weather!  The diag wasn't the most verdant place (the snow washes away yet everything is so dirty) but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  We grabbed Jimmy John's on the way then sat by the flagpole.

      Last night, Joe and I had planned a little gathering.

We started off playing spades, chowing down snacks and drinking beer.  Eventually more people showed up so we got pizza, played some GT3 and broke out the hard liquor.  When it was time to leave for the movie, we voted and decided it would be more fun to stick around.

      Deadly Sins  



ANGER 

1.  Who did you last get angry with?   I guess I would have to say Chris Payne.  He was acting very out of character last Saturday night. 

2.  What is your weapon of choice?   First choice is words, second choice is the fist. 

3.  Would you hit a member of the opposite sex?   Under 99.99% of circumstances, never.  The only reason I would ever hit a female would be to protect someone.  In all reality, I would probalby just hold them back if possible. 

4.  How about of the same sex?   Of course I would rail on a dude.  Dudes are made to be hit. 

5.  Who was the last person who got really angry at you?   Jamie.  Kids say the darndest things. 

6.  What is your pet peeve?   When people bite their fork.  It sounds like nails on a chalkboard and it seems so trashy. 

7.  Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily?   It depends on who it is against.  If it is with someone I am close to, it is usually quickly resolved.  Against someone I do not know well or do not like, it can last indefinitely.  



SLOTH 

1.  What is one thing you're supposed to do daily that you haven't done in a long time?   Use my teeth whitener.  All those years of drinking nothing but coffee and Diet Coke did a number on them. 

2.  What is the latest you've ever woken up?   5 PM.  I once pulled an all nighter and ended up going to bed around noon. 

3.  Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't?  Hmm, my maternal grandmother.  

4.  What is the last lame excuse you made?   Not really an excuse, but just tonight Megan and I were at Borders.  There was a book called  Why Paint Cats  (yes, it's as weird as it sounds).  She actually bought a book called  Why Cats Paint  for her dad, so I said that this must be a sequel thus she must buy it. 

5.  Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through (one of the long ones...)?    Never.  I don't watch TV, other than  urlLink 24 . 

6.  How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today?   I didn't.  I don't need an alarm clock anymore.  When I quit drinking caffeine, my sleep requirements went from 8.5 hours a night to just about 5 hours a night. 

7.   How many times have you skipped work/classes this month?   Since I have a completely flexible work schedule, I cannot techincally skip work.  I think I've skipped two classes total.  



GLUTTONY 

1.  What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice?   SoBe green tea...   drool... 

2.  Meat eaters: white meat or dark meat?   White meat. 

3.  What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event?   Probably about 14 drinks in a single evening. 

4.  What's the most you've ever weighed?  188, the weight I am at now.  Ever since I started working out almost every day, I've gained about 10 pounds.  Hopefully I've actually lost some fat and gained more than 10 pounds in muscle. 

5.  What have you eaten so far today?   Breakfast was a bowl of cereal, a bagel and a can of mixed fruit.  Lunch was a veggie sub from Jimmy John's.  Afternoon snack was crackers with peanut butter and jelly.  Dinner was another sub, this time a ham one from Potbelly.  I am sure I will eat the equivalent of another meal before I go to bed.  Working out has dramatically increased my metabolism. 

6.  When was the last time you ate so much you felt sick?   The last time I got two subs from Jimmy John's after working out.  My stomach couldn't handle it, but my body was craving nutrients. 

7.  When was the last time you got drunk to the point of throwing up?   That time I had 14 drinks in an evening.  Playing poker with the guys and going shot for shot isn't a good call.  



LUST 

1.  How many people have you seen naked (not counting movies/family)?   3 plus naked mile plus however many people were on the wrestling and football teams in high school 

2.  How many people have seen YOU naked (not counting physicians/family)?  3 plus the teams 

3.  Have you ever caught yourself staring at the chest/crotch of a member of your gender of choice during a normal conversation?   Yes. 

4.  Have you ""done it""?    Yes. 

5.  What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice?   Eyes. 

6.  Have you ever been propositioned by a prostitute?   No. 

7.  Have you ever had to get tested for an STD or pregnancy?   No.  



GREED 

1.  How many credit cards do you own?   I personally have 2 in my name and then there is a card that is a joint account of myself and my aunt and a debit card. 

2.  What's your guilty pleasure store?   I guess J. Crew. 

3. I f you had $1 million, what would you do with it?   I would move out of my crappy apartment, buy a few  urlLink cars  and try to invest the rest. 

4.  Would you rather be rich, or famous?   Rich.  Being famous is pointless. 

5.  Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks?   Aren't all jobs inherently boring to some degree? 

6.  Have you ever stolen anything?    Yes.  I vividly remember taking Vaseline lip balm when I was 6. 

7.  How many MP3s are on your hard drive?   Currently, 3,898.  



PRIDE 

1.  What one thing have you done that you're most proud of?   I am not really proud of anything yet.  I will find pride when I have a happy, stable family. 

2.  What one thing have you done that your parents are most proud of?   Anything academic.  They've been proud of me so far in all aspects though. 

3.  What thing would you like to accomplish in your life?   Other than the happy, stable family, I would like to make some lasting contribution to whatever field I end up working in. 

4.  Do you get annoyed by coming in second place?   Of course!  I am more competitive than almost anyone I know. 

5.  Have you ever entered a contest of skill, knowing you were of much higher skill than all the other competitors?   Again, of course.  It's so easy to crush people that way, and crushing makes me feel whole. 

6.  Have you ever cheated on something to get a higher score?   Of course. 

7.  What did you do today that you're proud of?   I set a new max on my bench press.  I'm only at 250 pounds though.  



ENVY 

1.  What item (or person) of your friends would you most want to have for your own?   Currently, Zig's car would be nice.  I want something faster though. 

2.  Who would you want to go on ""Trading Spaces"" with?   Kristin Happ, since she is the only person I know that watches that show more than my parents. 

3.  If you could be anyone else in the world, who would you be?   No one. 

4.  Have you ever been cheated on?   Actually, I don't know.  I may have been cheated on with two different girls, but I have no proof. 

5.  Have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own?   Yes, I wish my skin was clearer and I was less hairy. 

6.  What inborn trait do you see in others that you wish you had for yourself?   Complete confidence.

      Today while I was working out at the CCRB, a girl actually hit on me.  This has happened maybe three times in my entire life.  Here are the details:  The wrestling mats were laid out in the martial arts room because a session of aikido had just concluded.  I had just finished my cardio and lifting and was walking around a bit to cool down.  When I saw the mats, I decided to do some of my wrestling rolls just as a cool down.  I started off walking on my hands because that was the most fun and was the most strenuous.  A girl that was stretching at the end of the room started watching me.  I ignored it, since she was just watching because who walks on their hands?  Thirty seconds later, she came up to me and asked if she could join me.  At this point, I was a bit confused.  I hadn't been hit on in a very long time so I didn't know what to do and I also have a very serious girlfriend.  I didn't want to blow this girl off just for the sake of being rude, but I couldn't lead her on in any way.  Anyway, I said of course she could join me and she asked if I did gymnastics.  I explained that I used to walk on my hands when I wrestled in high school.  She asked if I wrestled for Michigan and I just laughed.  We introduced ourselves and she then said that she does hand stands because she used to do gymnastics in school and that now she likes to breakdance.  She started to show off by walking on her hands and then doing single handed dismounts.  At this point, I either had to commit or bail.  Instead of committing by asking about her dancing, I simply said that I had to get going.  She laughed out of obvious nervousness, probably because she didn't want me to leave.  I simply grabbed my water bottle and headphones and ended that encounter.

      There are enough MP3s on my computer to listen for over a week straight and never hear the same song twice.  Winamp says 183 hours, 14 minutes and 1 second worth of musical goodness is available.  Since it is all on Kazaa, it is  available .

      If you have a second, do a search for my last name in Kazaa.  Over 259 files showed up all because I embedded my name in the ID3 tag of some MP3s I ripped.  These songs were ripped my freshman year of college and then placed on my FTP server.  At the peak, this server got over 100,000 hits in a single weekend.  It's fun to see that my files have spread across the globe.

      When I get older and I own a home, I will have a personal library.  I'm not talking about a den that has a large shelf of books.  I'm talking about a room devoted solely to housing books.  If my (or my wife's) affluence accounts for it, the books will all be bound in the same color and style (not necessarily leather).

      The waters choppy, but it doesn't cut me, no 

'Cause I ain't sinkin', no I ain't goin down below 

I don't think that way, you know I never have 

Well I cant slow down now just because you lag  



You're always pulling, keep on trying to bring me down 

I'm going to show you that I don't like to fuck around 

You show your face and I'll look the other way 

You blink your eyes and you've got no friends to play  



Pick up the slack 

I won't carry your monkey on my back 

Save the world 

Got no time, I've got to save myself today  



I've got a mission to fulfill the things in life 

I've got a lot of things to see before I live to die 

All this negativity tries to bring me down

      Benadryl =  bad.    I've been taking Claritin for years now, at least since high school.  Just recently, they came out with an over-the-counter form of Claritin.  Now my health insurance doesn't cover perscriptions to Claritin and the OTC version costs $13 for ten doses!  When my prescription to Claritin had run out at school and I needed something to tide me over until I made it to the doctor next, I would just get an off-brand  urlLink antihistamine/decongestant .    When I went to the store to pick some up, they were all out so I decided to try the  urlLink Benadryl version .  Not at good call at all!  Some people take Benadryl just as a sleep aid and now I know why.  I took two in the past few days and my sleep needs have gone up at least 25%.  I even fell asleep in the car when Leah's mom was driving us back to Ann Arbor!  I had to take a nap from noon until 2 PM today even though I got more than my normal amount of sleep last night.  Does anyone need a sleep aid?  I'm not taking anymore of these.

      I am definitely not a big fan of Star Trek, but I've been known to watch quite a bit of The Next Generation and some Deep Space Nine.  Slashdot had an  urlLink article  about Enterprise and how Rick Berman is going to try to salvage it.  The discussion about this article ranged from how Berman needs to be executed to reasoning why the first series were much better.  Out of the blue comes  urlLink this comment .  It is an idea for a new Star Trek show.  The basic premise is of a cadre of special ops members of the Federation that take care of the dirty work.  Read the comment.  If it was shot in a dark, plodding, almost psycho manner, it could be a hit.  If it turns into another wild cowboy show, it could fail.

      If the visitors of  urlLink Kempa.com  made up a list of best albums of all time, the concensus for the top spots would be: 

Radiohead - OK Computer : (9 votes) 

Weezer - Pinkerton : (7 votes) 

Beach Boys - Pet Sounds : (4 votes) 

Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime : (3 votes) 

Pavement - Slanted and Enchanted : (3 votes) 

Beatles - Abbey Road : (3 votes) 

Sloan - Twice Removed : (3 votes) 

Sadly, I do not have two of these albums (Abbey Road and Double Nickels On The Dime).  I should fix that soon.

      Ok, now I have a bit of time to talk about my weekend.  Thursday, I ended up going out with Jamie and Chris.  I really think we have coalesced and get along great as a threesome now.  That is depressing because Chris officially moves to Chicago on Wednesday.  But anyway, we had a good time.  We ended up going to Scorekeepers because of the enticement of $3 pitchers of Coors Light.  We were surprised to find out that before 10 PM, there were $1.50 pitchers of both Coors and Killian's.  Needless to say, we finished off four of them between 9 PM and 10 PM.  Since it was a Thursday, the place was packed like Chinese in the SARS treatment office.  I saw at least four people that I knew, possibly more.  

Friday was the  urlLink Compulsive Lyres  concert.  I hadn't been to an a cappella concert in quite some time, even though I went often in my first few years here.  The Lyres put on a great performance, as did the  urlLink Friars  and the  urlLink Maine Steiners .  Not so great was the Indigo dance team.  After being introduced, they were late getting on stage, couldn't find their places, had to reorganized everything on stage and then the music problems kicked in.  First, there was a boom box on stage that was used as a prop by the Lyres.  For some reason, the dance team thought their music was going to be played on said boom box.  First they couldn't figure out how to turn it on, then they noticed that there was no CD in it.  They looked around confused, got into their dance positions just as their music started  blaring  over the auditorium speakers.  This was just the beginnings of their problems.  Two of the girls just could not stay in sync which threw everyone off.  Though there were many little kids in the audience, most of their music was about sex and filled with swearing.  Needless to say, even though they were scheduled to dance during two portions of the show, they didn't return.  After the show was the Lyres after party at Colonial lanes.  It was a Rock 'N Bowl night, which actually turned out to be quite fun.  Jamie, Alissa, Bri and I bowled a couple of games and none of us broke 100.  Somehow, Jamie found a way to bowl that required her to clench her left butt cheek for balance.  Her butt was sore for days afterward.  We all had fun while bowling, but things got a bit tense early in the morning.  Saturday, Chris and I hung out for most of the day.  His back is pretty messed up, so we went to the doctors first.  The rest of the day was spent playing video games (Tekken 4 and NWN).  That night, Jamie, Zig, Eric, Matt, Kristin and I went to Charlie's and then back to Jamie's place.  Things got a bit crazy at Jamie's since I ended up putting Crisco in Zig's mouth at one point.  I thought it was maybe 1 AM when I finally went to bed but Jamie informed me later that it was closer to 5 AM.  Whoops.  Anyway,  urlLink here  are the pictures from that night.

It doesn't matter how good you think the Ducks are, the fact is that we were swept.  None of the games were blowouts, but even that fact is inconsequential.

      Sorry for the lack of posts lately, the end of the semester is hitting hard.  Yesterday, the weather was gorgeous, so Leah and I took a walk through the Arb.  Afterwards I made dinner and subsequently felt extremely tired.  She ran off to a few group meetings and it was time for me to study for the rest of the night.  The combination of the weather, working out, taking a walk and a full meal wore me out, so I decided to make some coffee.  I haven't had large amounts of caffeine since I gave it up at the beginning of this year.  I drank half a pot in about an hour and a half.  

Let's just say that was a horrible idea.  I started to get pretty wired an hour in, but I figured that would be the only symptom.  I was so wrong.  My concentration started to wane, I was getting dizzy and then it got worse.  Eventually, I just wanted to either run around the room or puke.  I had to dry heave for a good five minutes until I could stand up again.  I got probably a good half an hour of work done between midnight and 3:30 AM when I finally fell asleep.

      I do realize that I will be graduating in three days, but I keep forgetting all of the little details that this entails.  Last week, I had my final class and final blue book exam.  This week, I wrote my final paper.  Tomorrow will be my final exam.  This is slightly overwhelming!  

A lot of things are going to be different when I graduate.  There are many little advantages I take for granted, like student pricing on tickets and all of the computing access I get from the university.  I need to figure out what I'm going to do for a primary email address!  I will probably move over to something like mike@bibik.org soon.  But where should I host it?  I don't want to pay for hosting, I am leaving the Daily soon so I can't use their servers and my home server doesn't have a static IP.  Oh well, that might be the least of my worries.  

More later, but for now, it's time for my second-to-last final!

      Let's see, where to begin...  First, the interview from a week and a half ago!  I can't divulge much information, for two reasons:  1)  I haven't gotten a yes or a no from said company.  2)  I had to sign an NDA before I could talk to anyone.  Let's see how many details I can give away without giving it all away.  

First, I was told that I would have anywhere between three and five interviews total.  There ended up being a total of six, which I can only interpret as being a hopeful sign.  I arrived at the recruiting building (yes, an entire building devoted to recruiting) around 8 AM and didn't end up leaving until around 6 PM.  Given a half hour for lunch, that was practically nine and a half hours of interviewing!  

Second, the riddles asked were fairly interesting and though I might have heard them all before, I had never solved any of them.  The first one wasn't so much a riddle as a generic design question.  I was asked how I would design the timing on any given traffic light.  I was allowed to request whatever information desired and then I had to come up with some formulas for making the ""best"" traffic light.  The first part of the problem was how to define ""best"".  What makes a good traffic light?  I decided it was a combination of two factors:  1)  Maximum throughput in all directions.  2)  Low traffic jam incidence rate.  After figuring out the formula for a single intersection, I had to modify it for a grid of intersections.  Then I was asked to ""think outside the box"" (yes, that phrase was used exactly) and figure out other ways to improve the experience.  All in all, a basic design problem.  

The second riddle was a programming question, something I didn't expect to encounter since I was interviewing for a management position.  Managers don't code!  I was given a 2D array and had to figure out the time it would take to sort it.  I barely remembered performance numbers for the different sort algorithms, but I remembered that quick sort was O(n log n) (and thankfully was correct).  Sorting a 2D array would thus take (O(n log n))^2.  The second part to the programming question was how to sort two already sorted linked lists.  This was simple, since you just setup two iterators that would move along the two lists, removing the smaller of the two items.  

The riddle I had the hardest time with was the cube desk calendar.  You have two cubes and you are allowed to put any single digit on any face.  With these two cubes, you have to represent every number from 01 to 31.  This turned out to not be that difficult when I realized you could mathematically approach this and define restrictions.  Some examples of these restrictions are that you need a ""1"" on each block since you have to represent ""11"".  The same thing for ""2"" and ""22"".  Eventually, I got to the point where I had six open spots on the cubes but seven numbers to put on the cubes.  This is when I realized that you could use ""6"" to represent a ""9"" and thus solved the puzzle.  

Almost all of the riddle had a mathematic basis.  The next riddle started off as a word problem.  A man starts at point A on a mountain and walks up to point B in exactly 12 hours.  At some time later, he walks down from point B to point A in exactly 12 hours.  He does not have a constant rate of ascent or descent.  The actual riddle was ""Can you prove or disprove the existence of a point P where the man took the same amount of time to reach the same spot on the mountain?""  I was having trouble trying to prove this, since it had to be true.  Eventually, I was given a hint to use a graph.  First I tried plotting time versus distance.  That was dumb.  Once I plotted time versus location, I showed that the plots must intersect and thus a point P does exist.  

The last riddle was one I heard a long, long time ago.  I knew the answer, but didn't know how to explain it at first.  This was the ""Let's Make a Deal"" riddle:  You have three doors to choose from, 1 with a prize and 2 without.  After you choose your door, the host of the show will eliminate one of the doors you did not choose and then ask you to pick again.  You can either stick with your original door or choose the remaining door.  The question is, do you stay or do you switch and why?  I knew you were supposed to switch, but couldn't think off the top of my head why.  Finally I realized that your initial chance at winning was only 1 in 3.  After the elimination, your chance is at least 2 in 3.  Switching is smart.  

Ok, that was the first of more updates.  I gotta run now though.

I will probably be moving out there between the end of June and mid-July.  I'm not sure yet.  There is so much I want to accomplish before moving, so many people to see and say goodbye to, it's overwhelming.  Today, I went car shopping.  I think I found the one I want, but it's a bit pricy for someone who won't be seeing that first pay check for at least two months.  I could wait, but I want it now!  ::whine::

      Mmm mmm, nothing like a good one month hiatus to get the not-so-creative juices flowing.  Where to start...  

Well, obviously, I started working at Microsoft!  The move out was emotional, if not uneventful.  The flight went fine, I got my month-long rental car just fine and I got into my new (temporary) apartment just fine.  Jenn so gratiously gave me a Gamecube just before I left.  That worked out perfectly because all of my stuff had already been packed to be shipped to the Seattle area so I had to take the GC on the plane.  If it wasn't for the TV and the GC, I probably would have died of boredom those first four days.  Imagine being in apartment without 99% of your belongings in a new city where you don't know anyone.  It was worse than I can describe.  Yeah, I cried off and on those first few days.  There are so many people back in the SE-MI area that I miss!  

Once I got through those first few days, life improved.  I got into a routine of waking up early and going to bed early to prepare myself for work.  I drove around town getting myself used to the area.  One big thing I've noticed is the marked difference in driving patterns.  Five over the speed limit is the most I've seen someone without a radar detector do.  Most people drive slower than the speed limit!  This could be because everyone is used to the traffic...   I swear to god it has to be some of the worst in the US.  The area is surrounded by water and mountains so the highways are not as plentiful as possible.  It's also difficult to widen any of the existing highways.  There are simply too many people and cars for the area.  They do have HOV (carpool) lanes, but it seems that very few people can take advantage of them.  I think I might start carpooling just because no one else is.  Some of the on-ramps are metered (meaning that there is a light that will allow only one car through every few seconds) but allow open access to the HOV lane.  I've also decided to change my car choice because of the traffic.  What's the fun in a  urlLink sports car  if you can't take advantage of it?  It's also possible that I will have a substantial commute, so gas mileage might be a big concern.  I also haven't chosen a city to live in, let alone an apartment.  Lots to do in the next couple of weeks!  

As for the job itself, I'm really not sure how much I can say.  I have a much better understanding of what I will actually be doing though!  From what I can tell, I will be a bug wrangler.  Basically, I will help the developers and testers eliminate bugs from already-released products.  Hotfix, updates, service packs, stuff like that.  Also, my title has changed in the past two weeks: Program Manager on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Product Group.  They changed from MDD (Mobile Devices Division) to MDPG (Mobile Devices Product Group).  I was told this is a common occurance and not to stock up on business cards since they will be out of date before I get them.  I can't tell anyone my phone number or office number since they are supposed to change in the next two weeks.  The entire group (MDPG) is being shuffled around to better coordinate the smaller groups (like CRT).  

If there is one thing I don't like about the job (yeah, already!) is that there are no set hours.  Basically, if you are in the office in time for meetings and you get all of your work done, you can work whatever hours you want.  Because of this, everyone has the mentality that they need to work 12 hours a day to look productive!  The first day (Monday), I simply told my boss that I was leaving when I had finished all of my day-one work.  He said that was okay.  Today (the second day), I ended up staying for 11 hours.  I got in around 7:30 AM, which is about 2.5 hours before most of the office gets in.  When 4:30 PM rolled around, I didn't think it would look right to leave.  The office was still packed!  I need to go to a car dealership tomorrow around 5 PM and the dealership is 30 minutes away.  I'm going to have to leave before 4:30 PM.  I don't care what it looks like, I'm working hard.  I was given a simple to-do list for the next two days and I've already finished it.  I'm doing well, so far!  

Anyway, that is all I have time for right now.  I still don't have my company-issued laptop and my two computers from home haven't shipped yet, so I have resorted to checking my Umich mail from the local library.  Hopefully this all gets rectified soon.  I miss you all!

      Added pictures from the  urlLink Fourth of July .  I guess I really should add some content other than just pictures...  On the Fourth,  urlLink Lee ,  urlLink Ben ,  urlLink Russ  and I went over to  urlLink Mark's  place for a BBQ.  A few other people stopped by, friends of Mark and Lee's from Umich.  We started cooking the meat before we realized that we didn't have any BBQ tools.  A few of us ran to the store and picked up a set, but that was after we had already melted a plastic spatula trying to remove some hamburgers.    

We cooked and chatted for a few hours, then decided to go to downtown Seattle for fireworks.  Russ and I took his car and Ben and Lee took Lee's car.  Let's just say that it was a case of the blind leading the blind.  Once we found where we were supposed to be, the traffic was unbareable.  It took us at least an hour to find parking, then another 30 minutes to walk to the park.  We met up with some other people just in time for some snacks and then the fireworks started!  The show wasn't terribly eventful; the Livonia fireworks were almost as good.  Afterward, most of the group was going to bars down in Pioneer Square.  Our group dwindled down to Lee, Ben, myself and a guy named Matt.  Neither Matt nor Ben wanted to go to the bar and Lee and myself are fairly laid back, so we succumbed to their will.  Instead of the bars, we went to 7-11 for slurpees then to Krispy Kreme for 18 donuts.  Pretty lame, but it was actually pretty fun.  

That's a bit more than a typical night with the guys, but we are hanging out quite often.  They are a fun bunch, and this is really helping me adjust to the Seattle area.  I will never forget the people back in the Ann Arbor - Livonia area yet I'm glad I've met some people out here.

      Jeff and I have started an actual honest-to-goodness workout routine.  We are shooting to work out at least 5 times a week (more depending on work load and possible visitors) and we are going to track our progress.  Currently, we take a notebook with us to record the exercises, weight and reps.  When I get back to work the next day, I update an Excel spreadsheet with the data.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the information, but never fear.  I'm a huge dork; I'm bound to make charts and graphs representing our progress.  

Since we also play racquetball every day, we sometimes don't get enough time to do as many exercises as desired.  Yesterday we were able to get through bench press, leg press, rope tricep pushdown, lateral pulldown, left and right obliques, hamstrings, and abdominals.

      My car has barely 2,300 miles on it and I already have to make an insurance claim.  I was driving on 520 from my apartment to the good Target in Redmond.  I'm following behind a Red Ford Expedition at a decent distance.  Out of nowhere, I see that he is about to run over a 4'x4' piece of plywood.  The SUV drives directly over it so that it goes between his wheels.  The downforce air pressure from the SUV causes the wood to fly up into the air.    

It flips slowly and at just the right angle so that when I PLOW into it, it is like hitting a wall.  Most of the board shatters into hundreds of car-scratching pieces but one 1.5'x1.5' chunk sticks to my bumper since I'm driving 60 MPH.  I pull off to the shoulder, slow down, the piece slides down and I run it over (possibly causing unseen tire damage).  

I just called the insurance agent and thankfully it will be covered.  Unfortunately, the adjuster is booked until next Saturday and I will have to pay my $250 comprensible deductible.  Oh well, I'm not that upset.  If I had bought a sports car, I would have been a bit peeved.  

Here are some  urlLink pictures of the damage :

      So, the trip to New York City   my first time, actually.  Ive been to a few large metropolises before:  Detroit, San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, Orlando and Toronto to name them all.  NYC is completely different from all of them and it starts with the ambiance.    

Starting out in Times Square had to affect my perception dramatically, though.  The overall feeling that spewed from the city wasnt the common perception of impatience, snobbery or discourteousness, but one of surging energy.  As Leah said, there is just so much to the city given that there are so many different sectors, each with its own life force.   Time Square was bursting with this power because of the sheer vivacity (tactless extravagance) and curiosity (aimless tourists).    

We also visited the rest of midtown, much of the upper East and West sides, downtown and even touched some of the NYU campus.  Blast to the fact that I didnt have my camera that night:  there is a cube almost identical to the one on the UMich campus!  The only difference is that theirs didnt spin.  As Leah and I noticed it and walked near, someone hopped out of the car at a red light.  He scampered over the cube and tried to give it a push.  He hopped back into his car and then gestured to his passenger that he knew of a cube that rotated.  I yelled to him The one in Ann Arbor spins, eh? and he looked back, slightly bewildered and replied in the affirmative.  

Since Leah had just turned twenty one the previous week, we hit a few bars during the trip.  She had received a few suggestions from coworkers and with the power of Pocket Streets on my Pocket PC, we hunted them down.  First problem:  one of the bars was called Bowery.  When I pulled a Find Place, it found Bowery alright.  It wasnt until we were in the heart of Chinatown with no one around that I realized that it found a street called Bowery and had simply shown me the centermost location on that street.  We used the Pocket PC to locate the nearest bar she had been recommended, headed in that direction, but ended up going to the closest bar we saw.  It was called Pioneer and wasnt too bad of a place.    

It was only 11:30 PM and while the bars in Ann Arbor or Seattle would be full at that time, NYC bars are open until 4 AM and dont seem to swell until 1:30 AM.  There were about 25-35 people inside total, but you couldnt tell by the noise level.  The DJ was blaring a mix of old and new dance (pop mostly) though no one was dancing and everyone had to yell over the music to hear each other.  Nonetheless, we had fun.  A few (expensive) drinks later, our tongues were looser and we both learned something.  Though I paid $7 for a shot, that wasnt anywhere near as bad as $26 for a Woo Woo (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) and a Cosmopolitan when we saw Cabaret!  

Cabaret was the first show we saw, but it did pale in comparison to Long Days Journey into the Night.  Jon Secada as the MC?  He can sing, but he cannot dance or act.  The actress that played Sally (Melinda Karakaredes (sp?)) did more than an admirable job.  I had seen the 1972 version of Cabaret with Liza Minelli, but I do believe that I fell asleep through part of it.  I could follow the story well since I had seen the movie, even if I couldnt understand some of the lyrics of some of the songs.  

Long Days Journey into the Night was our first idea for the trip.  It was closing weekend, Leah had heard nothing but good reviews and it had Brian Dennehey *and* Philip Seymour Hoffman!  Even though those seem like bigger names to me, it was Vanessa Redgrave that stole the show.  She had a much more difficult role to play and she absolutely sold it.  It was a character piece, and thus I was a huge fan.  Hoffmans role seemed small and insignificant at first, but then the final scene changed all of that.  Read the book or watch the movie to see what I mean.  

The three museums we hit (Met, Whitney and Guggenheim) simply reinforced my ideas about art.  If it does not show technical ability or is not visually appealing (very subjective), then its worthless.  I still dislike watercolors and most modern art, still like primary colors, pale orange and brown against white and silver, Mondrian and Rotko, Meiji period Japanese art, geometric abstraction and period fusion (example:  an series of WWII-style Japanese bombers in the shape of an infinity symbol over a burning current-day mid Manhattan done in the style of Edo period Japanese room screens using mother-of-pearl inlay and gold).  I probably spent more time in museums in the past four days than I have in the past 10 years combined.  No complaints.  

Well, thats it.  Pictures to come.

      Damn you, AT&T Wireless.  So the new Smartphone is finally coming to market and it is being heavily marketed.  AWS is going to have a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal on launch day and everything.  The new phone is being sold for under $300, which is actually a great price point for the hardware and services being offered.  The device is being sold internally to Microsoft at a 45% discount, which is also amazing.  

The problem is that AWS plans are so expensive!  Internally, the two plans being offered are $76/month and $95/month for 700 and 1,100 voice minutes respectively and 30 MB of data.  That is just WAY too much.  I thought spending $50 on my Sprint phone was overkill.  For unlimited data and 1,100 voice minutes, the price jumps to $109!  Come on.  Also, get this, those are the Microsoft discount rates!  For 1,100 minutes, it is normally $120 without data!  I feel like screaming.  

No cellular service is worth that much.

      Ugh and double ugh.  My current project at work has proved next to impossible and the deadline is being to peek over the horizon.  Basically, I need to categorize various bug fixes.  The difficult portion of this project is that I'm given the updated source code for each bug fix but the report needs to know the final location in our image of these fixes.  From what I've seen, there is no way to trace a source file to the eventual binary file in the image.  

I thought I had a good idea to build the image, apply the changes, rebuild and see which files changed.   I did that to a very small bug fix and 10% of the files changed (~1000)!  I figured that had to be wrong so I compiled the full image, made no changes then compiled again.  I saw that roughly 10% of the files had changed again.  This is going to be tough to figure out.

 It complements the flavors of so many foods.  I'm not going to start drinking it with pizza and burgers but it works with most everything else.

From the screenshots that were released early on in the development cycle, I wasn't too excited.  Now,  urlLink gameplay videos  are available and they have definitely changed my tune.  It's like they took all of the good aspects of the original game and improved upon them.  Bullet time looks cool and useful, unlike in the first game where it was a necessary evil.  Another thing I just noticed is that the object physics seem to be even better than the UT2K3 engine!

      Someone recently asked me to suggest a digital camera to these specifications:

 

 Small/compact

 Expandable memory (at least up to 512 MB)

 3x optical zoom

 4 megapixels

 

My suggestion turned out to be for the  urlLink Canon PowerShot S400 .  After looking around for cameras, I realized that the S400 is smaller and has better resolution than my S30 and costs the same price new.  Silly technology improvements.  

While whale watching, I encountered the only problem I have with my camera:  weak optical zoom.  Considering that the optical zoom on my S30 is only 3x and very few consumer-level digital cameras offer anything greater, I think I will have to stick with it for now.

       urlLink EMusic.com  is  urlLink changing drastically .  Gone are the days of 2000 downloads a month for $9.95 (well, $14.95/month for 3 months).  I  urlLink had a subscription  and I'm now glad that I cancelled it.  The new plan is $9.99/month for 40 downloads or $14.95/month for 65 downloads.  Given that Emusic.com mostly carries indie, most of my downloads were hit-or-miss.  I'd try something out just because they suggested it and sometimes it was great but more often it was deleted.  Now that the downloads are so restricted, usage patterns are going to be changed drastically as well.  

The site should be euthanized.

      Wow, the Wings season begins  urlLink tonight !  Being out in WA now, I'm curious as to how many games I'm going to be able to catch.  Tonight's game is on ESPN2, but I have flag football practice at 6 PM and the game starts at 4:30 PM (PST).  I'm curious as to how the goalie situation is going to work out and how Hatcher is going to fit in with our team.  I doubt we are going to win the cup, but I'm still going to follow the Wings heavily.  Since Seattle and even WA doesn't have a hockey team, I'm completely allowed to root for the Wings!

      Ok, so in light of the  urlLink car rental fiasco , I decided to add car rental coverage to my insurance.  I got a bit curious as to what my insurance rates would have been had I purchased a different car.  I used Progressive's online quote service and got some interesting numbers.   Note, the quote I got for my car was $1,439 while in all reality I pay about half of that.  For comparison purposes, I'm going to take $700 from each of the numbers I got.  That should be more realistic:

      Alright  urlLink Lindsay , let's see if I can match your dream posts.  

The first dream I had was more of a nightmare.  Basically, two shady guys were going door to door trying to sell Smartphones to people.  They had about 40 of the phones just tossed into a big plastic box.  I don't remember actually letting them into the house, but all of a sudden they were both in my parents kitchen trying to sell us AR11s.  As a side note, the  urlLink AR11  is our most hated device.  It would never see a retail market because it has so many problems.  

 Anyway, at first they were lackadaisically trying to get us to each buy a phone.  It seemed that they were both very tired, worn out and just wanted money.  It also seemed as if all the phones were stolen, obviously.  When we refused to buy a phone, they started to argue and yell at us.  Eventually, I took things into my own hands and started to beat on the leader of the two guys.  I didn't hurt him too much and suddenly he was gone.  I shoved his companion out the door and he rested against a parked car.     

Now this is where it starts to get weird and will be hard to imagine.  So picture that you are looking out the door of a house onto a driveway.  From your vantage point, you can see just the backend of a car parked in the driveway.  The second bad guy that I tossed out of the house was leaning against the car, facing the door.  He wasn't looking directly at me, but basically looking at the ground.  He seemed exhausted and looked to be resting a bit before moving on.   Suddenly and without warning, you see just a glimpse of the first shady guy come into the picture as he drops an axe down on the skull of the second guy, practically cleaving it in two!  For some reason, I busted out of the house and ran past both the man wielding the axe and his now-dead accomplice.  I felt that I was being chased a bit and then I felt everything had changed.  I looked around, and the man with the axe was now laying on his back on the hood of a different car.  His axe seemed to have bashed him directly in the face.   I focused past that and saw my mom's friend Evelyn holding a smoking gun!  I can only assume that while he was chasing me, she shot him in the back, he fell back onto the car and then his axe fell onto his face.  I woke up after that one.  

The second dream is fairly hazy, but I know some details.  The scene was the last day of class in presumably high school.  It was more like a boarding school because not only did we have to clean out our desks and say goodbye to students and teachers but we had to pack up our bedding and clothes as well.  I'm sure this has something to do with me reading so much Harry Potter lately.  I know there was some crying and there was a dark haired female teacher that we were all sad to say goodbye to.  The next thing I know, I'm getting married!  I don't remember much of the details, but it seems that in the dream I had a wedding and got married to Jamie, then we divorced, then I was getting married to someone else not a month later.  Weird.

      Ok, let's play with some numbers.  Here are the current  urlLink WRC  standings:  



(57 pts) Richard Burns 

(55 pts) Sebastien Loeb 

(53 pts) Carlos Sainz 

(48 pts) Petter Solberg 

(43 pts) Markko Martin 

(38 pts) Marcus Gronholm  



Burns is on a downward slope.  If his performance in Italy is any indication of his desire to win the championship, we can all but write him off.  Expect Burns to score maybe 8 more points over the last three rallies.  Loeb is hot now, but he is also inexperienced.  His car is sick, so if he can avoid a major retirement in Britain he is going to pull down at least 15 more points.  Sainz is too experienced to drop out of this championship without a fight.  He won't partake in any major gambling, but he will be consistant.  I'll give him 12 points.  Petter knows he needs to score some serious points to vault into the championship, so he will twist his natural talent into desperation.  At least two early retirements will keep him below 8 more points in the final rallies.  Markko is going to destroy the next two rallies.  Expect a first and a second place finish.  The final rally in Great Britain is going to decide this championship.  Gronholm has retired from the last three rallies.  Expect another two retirements with a third place race to finish off the season.  The final standings and points:  



(70 pts) Sebastien Loeb 

(69 pts) Markko Martin 

(65 pts) Carlos Sainz 

(64 pts) Richard Burns 

(56 pts) Petter Solberg 

(44 pts) Marcus Gronholm  



You heard it here first.

      Deciding to change my own oil may have been a bad call and I haven't even done it yet!  After calling around to four different oil change shops in the area, I decided to do it myself.  The cheapest I found was $25 and that was at a place I wouldn't trust.  I ran to Napa auto parts and purchased six quarts of Mobil 1, oil filter, filter wrench, funnel, shop rags and wheel ramps.  $70 in initial costs and an estimate of about $31 per additional oil change means I'm going to spend more money to do it myself!  Granted, the prices that I was quoted for an oil change was not for synthetic oil.  I guess it is more respectable to change your own oil...   nah, I screwed up.

      Car update:  So, you all know about the damage to my car ( urlLink original condition ,  urlLink information ,  urlLink damaged condition ).  For some reason when I signed up for auto insurance, I didn't elect to add rental car coverage.  My thought was simply that I doubt I will ever need to make a claim and if so it would only be for a couple of days.  I figured that if I needed to rent a car, paying for two days wouldn't be so bad.  Sigh, such stupidity.  

I took my car in two Mondays ago (09/22/2003) and expected to have it back by Wednesday.  When I dropped it off, they said it would be done by Friday at the latest.  Oh well, what can I do, I need a car so I will just pay for 5 days.  Friday rolls around and the car is not ready.  That sucks because the shop is closed on the weekends meaning at least three more days of renting the car.   Monday comes and the car is not ready.  Tuesday comes and the car is not ready.  Finally I pick up the car on Wednesday (10/01/2003) and they got the wrong fog lamp in so that wasn't replaced.  Total charge for renting a car for ten days:  $375!  All because I didn't want to pay the $60/year for car rental coverage.

      Endurance races in Gran Turismo 3 are a bitch!  The easiest one, im my opinion, is the Roadster race.  All of the cars are stock roadsters, so it's fairly easy to get a useable car from the start.  I used a Mazda LS with super-slick (AKA high-endurance) tires.  It took over 70 minutes to complete 40 laps, but I demolished the competition!  I lapped everyone and almost double lapped the slowest car.  There are four possible cars you can receive after winning this race (F688/S F1, Mazda Miata, Mazda Miata 1.8 RS or Mazda Miata RS) and of course I got the worst one (the plain Miata).  Sigh.

      Another night, another crazy dream though I can only rememeber a few details from this one.  Basically, I was a spy and my boss was the developer lead for my team.  My first task was to assemble a disguise that would let me infiltrate the ranks of my target.  It required some sort of black cape, weird black boots, a wig and makeup to look like an old woman and four old, silver coins.  I started to assemble this disguise and eventually realized it would not work and came up with a different one.  I had on tight black pants, black dress shoes, a beige collared sweater (sort of like this  urlLink one  but with a collar) with the collar up.  

Now that I had my disguise (if you can even consider that a disguise), I had to infiltrate the target location.  From my surroundings, the locale was possibly the city of New York, but checking my maps showed St. Petersburg.  So, yes, I was infiltrating a Russian installation.  From here, the rest of the dream is very fuzzy.  I do remember getting onto an elevator and having a woman roll her eyes viciously.  

I do remember some of the emotions that I felt.  When I was performing the first task, I knew that I was taking shortcuts and that my boss would be upset if he found out.  I believe the same thing happened when I was actually on my way to the base.  I was using some sort of device to track my location (probably a  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered device, naturally) and that was against the rules of engagement.

      So in the past two weeks of flag football, my team has lost 58-0 and 28-2.  Last week, my QB didn't remember how to hand off the ball and I plowed into him.  The starting QB and the starting RB, plowing directly into each other.  Too bad I was the taller of the two as my nose connected to his forehead.   The blood started flowing immediately.  This week, I jammed my middle finger on my right hand before the game started.   That wouldn't have been that bad but I was starting QB!  I couldn't feather out my floating passes like I wanted to and the team can't catch bullet passes.   I gave up five interceptions, I believe.

      About a week ago, I sent out an email to just about everyone in my address book that didn't live in Washington.  The email outlined my new contact info for both home and work and that's about it.  Well, some people didn't seem to appreciate this information:



 

From lwashnoc@yahoo.com 

Date: Mon, 6 Oct 2003 18:04:05 -0700 (PDT) 

From: Laura Washnock-DiPietro   

To: mbibik AT umich DOT edu  



Mike,  

 

I want you to stay completely out of my life, that is, after all, why I 

broke up with you.  This means that I do not want to hear from you and I 

do not want you contacting, in any way, my friends and family.  Trust me, 

they do not want to hear from you either.  I did not email you earlier 

because I did not want to talk to you.  I don't care about your new 

address and phone number.  I don't care about your new job.  In short, I 

don't care about what you are doing with your life.  I also do not care 

for you to know what is going on in my life.  

 

If you are looking for closure, here it is.  I broke up with you because 

you made me miserable.  You were emotionally abusive and controlling.  

You put me down and made me feel stupid for being myself.  When I broke 

up with you, I was too afraid of you to be this direct.  I am not anymore 

and I am sick of you trying to weasel your way back into my life.  Leave 

my friends alone.  Leave my family alone.  Leave me alone.  

 

Laura 

 



Seeing as how a regular reply might not be appreciated either and I always need to get the last word in, here is my open letter of reply:



 

Laura,  



First off, relax.  We have not talked since the beginning of this  

year.  I sent two emails over that period of time inquiring about your  

well-being.  I love how that is considered me trying to weasel my way  

back into your life!  I send an email to everyone in my address book about  

my new contact info and this is the reply that I get?  That is just a bit  

dramatic!  



Twice you mentioned leaving your family and friends alone.  I can only  

assume that you brought this up because they received the same contact  

info email as you did.  Had I known that would upset them so much, I  

definitely would have reconsidered sending it to them!  Sarcasm aside, I  

will not trust you when you say they don't want to hear from me.  A few of  

your friends didn't like me while we were together and I'm sure a few more  

switched sides when you broke up with me.  I do know that certain people,  

including at least one sibling of yours, think differently.  You may have  

requested that they all shun me but that cannot affect their true  

feelings.  Who is being the controlling one now?  It's a shame that you  

cannot trust them to make their own decisions.  



I made you feel stupid?  I'm sorry; I must have acted as a mirror of some  

sort, allowing you to see yourself for who you truly are.  It does not take  

much for someone whose only intellectual hobby is to watch VH1 for hours  

on end to think of themselves as being stupid.  Try reading a book.   

Better yet, try challenging yourself!  Outside of your required courses,  

did you take anything difficult in college?  I know you didn't make it  

into the honors program, but there are some difficult classes offered to  

the rest of the school as well.  



So, you broke up with me so that I would stay completely out of your life?   

Is that how it works?  Why is it that so many other people have the ability  

to break up and at least be cordial?  Actually, if I remember correctly,  

you have no contact whatsoever with any of your exes.  Why is that?  Do you  

understand how to forgive people?  Are your emotional abilities so  

black-and-white that once you break up with someone, all emotion toward  

them must turn to hate?  Do you even understand how to separate the  

concepts of friend and significant other?  Hopefully you will learn with  

Alex.  Hey, he was one of my good friends back in elementary school.  He was  

probably one of the main reasons why we broke up and still I do not hate  

him.  Forgive and forget.  



Here is my take on the situation as a whole.  You met Alex while we were  

together and while our relationship was having problems.  Having a small  

shred of morality, you knew that you couldn't cheat so you decided to  

break up with me to be with him.  Though we did have problems, there was  

still some good in the relationship.  While you were with Alex, you had to  

channel that emotional energy somewhere.  The easiest emotion to channel  

into is hate, so there it went!  It is much easier to hate someone with  

support from people you are close to so you slandered me enough to gain  

this support.  When you saw my latest email, you felt a slight twinge of  

interest but you had to kill it.  Instead of forgiving and forgetting, you  

redirected that twinge into the anger spewed forth in your email.  For that  

emotional outburst, I applaud you.  



Even if I am completely wrong, know that you have now proved yourself as  

the paragon of emotional puerility you were destined to become.  



M.

      My apartment complex is comprised of four seperate buildings that share a single underground parking garage.  When Russell and I moved in, we took two of the last parking spots available.  They were over by building B while we lived in building A but it is just a short 30 meter walk across the garage.  Last night after working out, I followed another car into the garage.  They parked over by building A while I parked by building B.  We crossed paths as we went to the opposing building.  I didn't think anything of it, but she called out to me just as I was about to enter the building.  We traded contact info and decided that we should trade parking spots.

      As of today,  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered  urlLink Smartphones  are available in the US!   urlLink AT&T Wireless  is carrying the  urlLink Motorola MPx200 .  This is a monumental leap forward for my department.  We have been working on the Smartphone platform for years and we are now in the US market!  The AT&T site is selling the phone for $299, but until 10/28/2003,  urlLink Amazon  has the  urlLink phone for $149.99  (after $150 mail-in rebate).  

It is difficult to explain just how powerful these phones are in words.  First off, it's a great phone.  Reception is rarely an issue, audio quality is fantastic and all the features of a regular phone are there.  Combine that with a full-fledged PIM (calendar, contacts, tasks, email), MP3 and video player, Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and more!  An additional feature that not many people know about is you can use most of these phones as a wireless modem as well!  Anywhere you go with your laptop, just connect your phone with the provided USB cable and now you are on the internet!  

The longer I am in this department, the more I love the products.

      So last night was the  urlLink big go-karting event  at  urlLink Champs Karting .  Racers:  Katherine, Russ, Jeff, Jeff's sister, Jeff's sister's boyfriend, Lee, Mark, Andy, Kevin, Joel, Dennis, Rob and another Jeff.  It's a shame that Champs online results system is broken because then I could give actual speed numbers.  At Champs, each race is 18 laps and because of the staggered start, the winner is whomever has the fastest single lap.  I raced with Katherine, Mark and Lee.  Mark set the fastest lap of the night (for our group) with a 20.00 flat.  Lee was second with a very close 20.03 and I was third with 20.30.  

The track was fairly small but I didn't fully figure it out until about half way through.  As you can see on  urlLink this map , there are a few hairpin turns.  The worst was turn 3.  No matter what I did, I couldn't seem to get enough exit velocity.  If it was a real car, I would have changed the gear ratios for faster low-end acceleration.  I figured out how to gain some serious velocity through turns 1 and 2, but 3 was my down fall.  I'm sure another go at it and I would improve by at least .3 seconds a lap.  

Overall, I think everyone had a good time.  Jeff and crew had to leave early since they had just gotten in from across the country that morning.  His sister honestly looked like she pulled two all nighters.  You know that glazed, watery look?  She had a textbook case.  Jeff will probably drag me back there, no worries.  

Afterward, Katherine, Russ, Lee and I went to Belltown Billiards.  We were supposed to meet up with Lee's friend Craig, but he never showed.  Everytime I go to the bar, I can never think of a cool mixed drink to order.  I need to work on a list.

Basically, once the drug has been accepted by the hospital, smaller practices near the hospital will pick it up.  Once it's spread through one area, other hospitals may pick it up soon after.  Getting a hospital to accept your drug is no easy process.  A representative doctor will get drilled about all the details on a drug for hours on end in front of a huge committee.  Kat's father is a cardiologist.  By basically his idea, his impetus and his work, he got one of her drugs approved at the local hospital.  The hospital was not in her territory, so she knew that some of the credit would naturally fall to the territory owner.    Last night after a hard day of work, she got home and checked her email.  Her boss sent out an email to the entire west coast staff including her great great grandmanager.  The announcement basically gave 110% of the credit to this other person and practically put Kat down!  The wording of the email stated that this other person did all of the work, Kat basically helped the morning of the final presentation (implicating that she was late with the work and lazy) and gave very little credit to her father.  Naturally, she was appalled.  It's going to be hard to repair all of the damage that single email has done.  I suggested it was time to start becoming a backstabbing, credit-grabbing bastard like the rest of her coworkers.

      I need to cut caffeine again.  As stated in this  urlLink survey , my sleep requirements went from 8.5 to 5 hours when I quit caffeine.  I wasn't exactly sure if it was the lack of caffeine or the dramatic increase in exercise that was the cause of the change.  Now that I'm still working out just as much (or more) and I'm back on caffeine, my sleep requirements are back at 8.5 hours.  

It wouldn't be such a bad thing if I wasn't falling asleep at inopportune moments...

      So I'm back to including a bit of cardio into my exercise regime.  On Tuesday, Jeff decided he wasn't up for racquetball so we did 30 minutes of cardio before lifting.  I hit the elliptical for that entire time, burning over 400 calories.  Lifting directly afterward felt so much different than normal where we start with lifting.  Basically, every exercise seemed at least 15% more difficult.  Anytime I have to grunt through an entire set of bench presses, I shouldn't be doing that much weight (nor does anyone actually want to hear me grunt).  Last night, Jeff had two futbol games to play with his MS club so I hit the gym alone.  Again, 400 calories on the elliptical.  

Many people have commented on my increased size (I've assumed musculature so far since most of these people wouldn't say ""Man, looking a little pudgy there, Mike!""), but I feel that all the added muscle mass is simply pushing the existing fat out farther.  I'm almost tempted to scale back lifting in favor of cardio, but then I wouldn't be making progress in strength.  I've added at least 25 pounds to my bench since we started working out at the end of the summer.  Maybe I should just get liposuction and keep lifting!

       urlLink FCC allows home numbers to be switched to wireless phones - Nov. 11, 2003 :  When I first read this article, I thought ""Great!  So many people will love this feature.""  Now that I really think about it, how much use is this really going to get?  Ever since cell phones became popular, adding a new phone number became a routine occurance.  It is not that big of a deal to change a phone number.  I could have a skewed viewpoint because almost everyone that has my phone number also has an email address.  Everytime I changed phone numbers (which happened every year in college and once again when I moved out to Washington), I've sent out an email announcing the change.  It could be much more difficult for other people that do not have an alternate form of communication.

  

 I can see this being used by people that ran a business line in their home.  They can keep the same number, which is probably on business cards, websites, etc but now have it tied to a mobile phone.  Since I work in the mobile phone industry, any way to get more people to switch is fine with me!  

I do see one issue with this ruling though.  Up to this point, I believe that telemarketers relied on the fact that cell phones and landlines were completely seperate.  They knew which extensions mobile operators had and would not call those numbers (since it is illegal to telemarket to a cell phone since it costs the customer money).  Now, that line is completely removed.  Is there going to be a national database of cellular versus landlines?  How secure would that be?

      Animals, animals and more animals.     Russell's older brother is currently studying to be a veterinarian.  Before we moved in together, Russ mentioned that he might want to get a dog eventually.  Back then, I stated that I wouldn't have any problem with that whatsoever as long as he was the one to take care of the dog.  I wouldn't mind having to ocassionally fill a food dish or take the pup out for a walk, but that would be about it.  The topic was dropped then, but Russ' brother recently had to spay/neuter a puppy for his studies.  Usually, these dogs are mutts from the Humane Society, but this one turned out to be a purebred doberman pinscher.  

Since this dog was just so darned cute, Russ had to bring up the idea of getting a dog since his brother could give it away to anyone.  I said the same thing as before but pointed out that this dog wasn't going to be small for very long.  Also, he would probably destroy something if he was kept in the apartment by himself for 10+ hours a day.  We agreed, no puppy for us.  

Kat and her parents have a total of three cats.  Two of them, Charlotte and Emily (the ""Bronte Sisters"") have been with the family for quite a few years now.  They are a mix between what seems to be to be a Russian Blue or Chartreux and an orange English Shorthair.  The third cat is Sebastian, a brown tabby, and is only 6 months old.  Emily is fairly social, so it wasn't much of a surprise when she felt comfortable enough to come up to me.  The other two are a different story.  Sebastian is still in the playful kitty phase, but Kat told me that I'm the only person other than herself that he has cuddled with. As for Charlotte, she isn't terribly social so Kat is also surprised when she always comes up to me for affection.  I think Kat is just jealous!  

Kitties love me.

      You never know how hard it is to find an available dumpster until you need one.  I just spent 20 minutes driving around a dark and rainy Bellevue looking for such a creature.  I needed to dispose of a few plastic containers that I used to move in and our apartment complex only offers a chute for trash bags.  These plastic totes barely fit into my hatchback, so they sure as heck were not going to fit down that chute.  

Thankfully, there is a large string of medical centers about a block from here because of the hospital being so close.  Friday night at 5 PM, the day after a holiday, few people are going to be in the office.  I found a dumpster and it found my totes.

Note to self: the combination of turkey, rich chocolate cake and port means you will fall asleep very soon after the meal.

       urlLink Ford to drop SVT Focus, put entire SVT lineup on hiatus :  No more SVT Focus!  That is a shame because just about every review I've read of the car said it was outstanding.  I really shouldn't think about the SVT too much because I want to kick myself for getting the ZX3 instead.  The retail price on my ZX3 was MORE than a well-equipped SVT and the SVT is a better vehicle in almost all regards (other than noise and softness of ride).  170 HP, almost as fast as a 911 Carrera in the slalom, okay gotta stop thinking about it.  If only I was more comfortable with a manual, I would have bought it back in July...  

Anyway, back to the article.  The ST model that is mentioned is probably similar to the UK-spec ST170:  basically the same engine as the SVT (170 HP) but without the rest of the upgrades (suspension, tires, brakes, interior, transmission, etc).

      Weekend update:  



On Sunday, I finally made it to a donation center.  When I first moved out to Washington, I brought all of my college apartment furniture, electronics and applicances.  I figured that I would have enough startup costs with moving into a new apartment and buying a car that I could use my old college crap for awhile to get me by.  I dropped quite a bit on the down payment for the car and had to buy a few essentials for the apartment (sofa, bed, desk, dresser, bookshelves, everything for the bathroom, etc) so I was glad I brought everything else.  I've slowly replaced a few items and instead of getting rid of them immediately, I just tossed them into the corner of the room!  Basically, we had an extra TV, VCR and TV stand in our living room for the past three months.  Kat showed me the local Goodwill donation center Sunday morning so I packed up the ol' Focus hatchback and finally made a donation.  

I got rid of said TV, VCR and TV stand along with two huge garbage bags of clothes (cleaned and folded, thank you), microwave, toaster, coffee pot and some other assorted items.  They didn't take the TV, so I just tossed it into the garbage/recycle room in my complex.  If it's still there after trash day, I will probably take it to a real recycle center since Jeff informed me that the tube contains toxic materials.  



After getting rid of so much stuff, I decided I need to fill those now-empty spaces with new stuff.  I picked up a duvet cover and blanket (both in dark blue) and then Jeff and I went out shopping.  On the way to Ikea, we decided to check out Fry's.  It can only be described as a combination of the best parts of Best Buy and Radio Shack in a Wal-Mart sized setting.  Automatic geekgasm.  At Ikea, I picked up a  urlLink frame  for my  urlLink Hokusai Katsushika  print.  It's not terribly Japanese, I know, but I simply like it for aesthetic reasons.  Jeff had to continually remind me that I am heterosexual so that I wouldn't  urlLink buy   urlLink certain   urlLink prints .  But come on, with a blue and white theme in my bedroom,  urlLink this  would complement it well!  



On Saturday, Jeff, Russ, his two visitors, Rebecca and Rob, and I went to  urlLink Rocksport  in West Seattle to see  urlLink Michigan defeat Ohio State .  I was about to say ""upset Ohio State"", but we all knew who was going to win!  Rocksport was an interesting place to see the game.  All but a handful of people were there specifically to cheer on the Wovlerines as the Seattle alumni association goes there for every game.  They served (a fairly crappy) breakfast, but service was surprisingly good for a bar at 9 AM.  After the game, Jeff and I hit Kenneth Cole ( urlLink shoes  in brown/tan,  urlLink shirt ,  urlLink shirt  in black).  After a quick lunch, we hit the gym.  That night, Kat and I went to Cutters for dinner (not terribly impressed) and then had a quiet night at home.

       urlLink Mitsubishi announces Lancer WRC04 :   After taking a year off from rallying, Mitsubishi has returned with a radical new vehicle to enter the '04 WRC season.  The overall body shape has remained similar to previous Mitsu WRC cars, but the underlying construction, components and technologies are radically different.  

Personally, I am not a fan of the looks of the new car.  I can definitely see how it would be more aerodynamic than the last model, but they needed to make a few sacrifices in the visual appeal area.

      Yesterday, I was talking to the person on my team that is setting up our holiday party.

I told her that the menu seemed fairly extravagant, so I was definitely going.  She hadn't seen that email and she couldn't find it in her inbox, so she asked me who sent it so she could search for it.

I spent quite a few hours at  urlLink Bellevue Square  and hit at least 20 stores.  One of the last stores I went to, mostly out of curiosity, was Armani Exchange.  Personally, I hate their clothing.  It's either label-saturated or a misguided attempt at being trendy.  While I was there, I had not one, not two, not three, but four different sales people try to help me.  Normally I walk into a store like that and I'm lucky to get any help.  The last sales person, male, got my attention by staring directly into my eyes for a second.  I turned away, then noticed he was still watching me.  I made eye contact again and he started up conversation.  Most of it was ""how is shopping going"", ""who are you buying for"" and basic salesperson chat.  When he said ""What are you doing afterward?"", that was when I figured out I was being hit on.  My response ""Probably just some more shopping."" with a condescending smirk ended that discussion.

      Once again, learning something not from Slashdot, but because of links found there.  Starting with  urlLink this discussion about a nuclear-powered mission to the moons of Jupiter , there was a link to this  urlLink article , stating that crash landing a nuclear-powered probe into Jupiter could cause it to turn into a star.  Basically, this article is full of facts and a gross misuse of these facts.  They have correct information about the Galileo craft and some fairly factual discussion about fission, fusion and bombs.  While it is true that the materials on the craft could be used for a fission bomb, they completely ignored the concept of critical mass.  I couldn't think of the right term while reading the incorrect article, but the question of just how much plutonium was necessary came to mind.  

Bad Astronomy saves the day and debunks the possiblity of a small nuclear-powered probe turning Jupiter into a star with this  urlLink article .  The critical (pun intended) points here are:

 

 The plutonium onboard Galileo was kept in small pellets, none of which were near critical mass.

 The hydrogen on Jupiter is of the most abundant isotope and lacks deuterium and tritium needed for a fusion reaction.

 Jupiter is about 1/80th the size needed to be a self-sustaining star.

 

I love science.

      I just had a pretty crazy dream.   I don't remember all the details, but I know it involved trying to go to a play, or a conference or something.  To me, it seemed like we were in East Lansing, or some other college town that I've visited but didn't know too well.  The overall theme of the dream seemed to concern men versus women, and more specifically, women standing up to men treating them poorly.  Some of the people that were in my dream:  Jenn, Laura, Angie, Steve Jackson from the Daily and some girl that I just barely remember being a friend of Rob and Gareth.  

I don't really remember the play/conference/whatever, but I know that we went out to eat afterwards.  The place was called BD's, but instead of it being like BD's Mongolian BBQ, it was more like Dixie's BBQ and was fast food.  The restaurant was so darkly lit that I couldn't even read the menu and was about to just order a ""Number 1 Combo"" just to be safe when an altercation occured.  Some guy brushed up too close to the girl that I just barely remember and so she yelled at him and shoved him.  A couple of other guys were just loitering around that area and started to make fun of her.  That's when I stepped in, put one of the guys in an arm lock and said ""Do you like having the use of this arm?""  He was quiet after that.

      Weekend update:  

Friday turned out a bit differently than I originally expected. I knew that Kat was leaving for a business trip on Sunday morning and that she would be pretty busy getting ready on Saturday night, so I planned on seeing her.  Around 7:30 PM, Mark called and said that he was going out to some bars downtown with Dan and some friends.  I figured that Kat, Jeff, Russ and I hadn't been out drinking in awhile so I thought we could all get together.  Well, all the stress of trying to close on a new townhome, stress of work and stress of trying to get ready for a week-long business trip caught up to Kat.  She decided that I should just go out with the guys and have fun.  No way!  If this was probably the last night I would get to see her for a week, of course I was going to try to see her.  I basically had to convince her to let me come over and that I would go out with the guys afterward.  We had a fairly quiet night at her place and I tried my damnest to wash away some of her stress.  By the time I got back to my apartment, Russ was sound asleep and Mark never called me to say where he would be downtown.  That ended that night.  



Saturday was a bit more productive.  I figured that I wouldn't be able to see Kat at all, so I was going to tackle some Christmas shopping.  Before I got started with that, Jeff and I grabbed lunch at King and I, a Thai restaurant near his apartment.  Not too bad, but their take on ""3 star"" spicy was definitely including White Man Penalty and was thus fairly mild.  I then headed over to the local mall and spent a good three hours shopping.  I was looking mostly for gifts for my parents but I seemed to find more gifts for myself.  Not surprising.  



Kat called me soon after that saying that she was mostly ready for her trip and that we should hang out for a bit.  We originally decided to grab coffee some place, but by the time we actually got around to leaving her place, it was dinner time.  She felt like Mexican, so we started off toward Fremont since she knew of a fairly authentic restaurant out that way.  Traffic over the bridge to Seattle was horrendous, so we turned back to Bellevue.  We hit  urlLink Spazzo , which recently changed from Mediterranean to Italian. and had a fairly nice meal.  The wine was better than the entrees and the goat cheese appetizer was served with bread that was impossibly hard and terribly over-soaked in olive oil.  All in all, a nice evening, as most are with her!  



Today was completely lazy...  I didn't do anything productive until 3 PM, unless you count making eggs for breakfast and playing an hour of Grand Theft Auto III as productive.  Russ and I visited  urlLink Caffe Ladro  so I could read more of The Brothers Karamazov and he could study for accounting.  It was good going out with him since we spend so much time in the apartment.

Turf shoes have amazing traction on almost any surface, including the hardwood floor of the rball court.   Whenever I land from a jump, I keep my foot perpendicular to my shoulders until I land, when I rotate my foot away from my body for added balance.  that is how you are supposed to land.  Well, when I landed this time, I went to rotate my foot but my shoe decided to have super traction and not move.  All of the rotational force went straight to the inner portion of my left knee.  

It was 10 PM by the time I got home, so I couldn't see a doctor on Monday.  The next morning, I waited until I heard from Kat to make an appointment since I figured her dad (a doctor) would be able to make a good recommendation.  When I called to make an appointment at 11 AM, they were booked for the day and I had to wait until Wednesday.  The x-ray shows that I definitely did some serious damage and that I also have a bone shard taken off the medial portion of my left knee.  Because of the amount of swelling, the doc recommended that I get an MRI.  That was done the same day but I will not get the results until at least Friday afternoon.  The current prognosis is a torn MCL, stretched ACL, torn meniscus and the bone shard.  Lovely.  

I'm currently wearing a huge brace but the pain is not so bad.  It comes and goes and luckily I can walk fairly well.  I missed a day and a half of work, so I'm a bit behind now.

      Disclaimer:  For no real reason, I have always disliked Walmart.  Maybe it was because, for the longest time, there were no Walmarts nearby either my hometown of Livonia, MI or my college town of Ann Arbor, MI.  That has since changed, with stores in or near both cities.  Maybe it was because Walmart always had a southern, poor slant to it.  Maybe it was because we had a similar store, Meijer's, in our area and I was pledging a local allegiance.  For whatever reason, I never liked Walmart.  



I've always heard that Walmart was an ""evil"" company.  From details like hiring illegal aliens for stock and cleaning work to treating ""regular"" employees poorly to pushing around suppliers, the comments swirled around and painted a dirty portrait.  When I was back working at the Daily with Scott as my manager, he spoke of Walmart as being worse than an other company he knew of.  He had facts from reputible sources, and though being an activist, used them properly.  Now having read this  urlLink article  from fastcompany.com, I'm starting to see the details about how Walmart interacts with suppliers.  From first glance, it does seem evil, overbearing and monopolistic.  At the same time, isn't that what capitalism is all about?  A mostly-free market for companies to do as they please?  Walmart doesn't force smaller suppliers to cut costs, Walmart is just such a large and successful company that the small suppliers need to be up to Walmart standards.  



I won't go so far as to condone their practices and I do agree that Walmart needs to improve their human rights issues, but don't fault a company for being successful.

      Let's see, what's been going on lately...  Chris and Lindsay are getting married this fall.  Definitely congratulations to them!  I am the best man, so that means I should get started on writing the toast.  I've been best friends with Chris since 1992 and I've known Lindsay for years, so I will have lots of material with which to work.  

My knee is slowly healing.  No longer do I need to wear my brace daily, just when exercising.  I no longer limp around and I have full range of motion.  I am supposed to go snowboarding this weekend, but that is not going to happen.  If I really want to heal on time, I need to do more physical therapy.  

There is some political crap going on at work, but I can't say much yet.  I still have a job, so I am okay.

      My parents were here for a week during the holidays.  There aren't too many highlights, since we decided to keep the vacation relaxing.  We didn't want it to be one of those vacations where you have to keep to a schedule and cram in as much as possible.  They didn't even go to the Space Needle!  Some of the places we did end up going were Snoqualmie Falls, Pike Place (NOT a good place for someone in a wheelchair) and a casino in Tulalip.  Other highlights include me making five batches of scones, cooking Christmas dinner and then Kat meeting my parents on the last night they were here.  I believe it was beneficial to have them out here, for both parties.  For thier sake, they got to see how I am living my life and meet some of the new people in my life.  For my sake, I got to see them for a little while in the comfort of my own home without having to break much from my normal routine.

      Dialing the time machine back to about a month ago...  

So, the holiday parties last month.  All three parties were right in a row this year:  Thursday was the organization-wide party at EMP, Friday was the team-wide party at a lodge at Snoqualmie Pass and Saturday was Kat's party at some little restaurant in Puyallup.  Thursday started off very slowly.  I was supposed to meet some of the younger members of my team at EMP around 7:30 PM and eventhough I got there at 7:45 PM, I was still early.  Eventually, everyone showed up and the party picked up.  The food was good, but the two drink tickets didn't last very long.  Being the ingenious people that we are, us Microsoft people, we figured out that we could simply exit the building, come back in, show our ID and get two more tickets.  Of course I didn't do this, but my ID was used by a non-Microsoftie for this purpose.  Afterward, a few of us were supposed to go out to a bar, but we all parted ways for a bit and we were supposed to reconvene 15 minutes later.   15 minutes later, one of the girls still hadn't showed up.  We were all a bit drunk and antsy to get away from the formal party, so we just left.  Four of us went over to a friends place and continued the drinking and watched some TV.  I ended up fitting five people in my car, dropped them all off, and called it a night.  

The next day, the team party was supposed to start at 10 AM, but since I knew there was no rush, I didn't end up getting there until 12:30 PM.  The drive up to Snoqualmie Pass was interesting at least for the fact that it was the first snow I had ever seen in Washington.  The farther up the mountain, the more snow there was (shocking, I know).  By the time I hit the exit for the Pass, traffic was down to 30 MPH.  I actually passed someone on my team on the exit, which wasn't surprising since he had a RWD Bimmer with bald tires.  Anyway, most of the day was pretty laid back.  A few of the highlights included me running the white elephant gift exchange (including a box of old Atari games, a Nascar coffee table book and a bike axle), playing DDR, and a snowball fight that included someone in a hot tub.  I picked up Kat from the airport that night, but I can't remember the rest of the evening.  

The final day of holiday parties was at some crappy little restaurant in a crappy little town far far south of Seattle.  This was with Kat's coworkers, who had an average age of just about 35.  It was slightly odd socializing with them, but luckily we got a table with the friendliest of the bunch.  The food was horrible, the drinks were crap, and the supposed white elephant gift exchange wasn't!  Kat brought a gag gift, since that's the point of a white elephant gift exchange, yet some of the other gifts included a fondue set, a set of nice martini glasses and a clock from Pottery Barn.  For dessert, I ordered decaf coffee.  Since I was awake until 5 AM and got about two hours of sleep all night, I believe it wasn't decaf.  Anyway, the parties overall were typical work holiday parties.

      So, I've heard of mice with too many additional buttons to be useful, but thankfully my new mouse just has left click, right click, scroll wheel, scroll up button, scroll down button, task switch and then two currently unassigned buttons that I would assume are used for forward and backward in a web browser.  That may sound like a lot of buttons, but I think of the scroll up and down buttons as just an extension of the wheel and the task switch button is miniscule.    Now the keyboard on the other hand is just asinine.  Along with the normal keys that a normal keyboard has (letters, numbers, punctuation, navigation and keypad), this one has seperate keys for scrolling, go, back, sleep, f-lock, e-mail, messenger/sms, webcam, media, mute, volume up/down, last track, next track, stop, play, iTouch, search, shopping, favorites, and my home.  Additionally to that, it has a function key to enable new, reply, forward, send, undo, redo, print, save, my computer, my documents, my pictures, and my music.  To make matters worse, they labeled the normal control key functions like undo, cut, copy and paste.  They keyboard is just a little bit overboard!

      Last night, I originally planned on leaving work a bit early, taking a nap, having a quick bite to eat and then hitting the gym with Jeff.  None of that happened!  Around 5:30 PM, Eric and I were talking about the new laptop he just ordered.  I told him not to buy Office from Dell since I could get a good deal on a legit copy of Office 2003 from work.  I decided to run to the company store right then since I was tired and needed a bit of fresh air.  After that, Lee sent me a chat request and convinced me to join him and some of his MS friends for dinner.  We went to Cucina Cucina (a decent to mediocre italian restaurant, thankfully we get 2-for-1 specials) and had a fun time.  It was good to meet new people, but I sometimes forget how horribly dorky we can all be.  I explained how Microsofties and non-Microsofties have difficulty mingling and there needs to be a certain percentage (we estimated 60%) of non-Microsofties for a group to work.  

I still planned on going to the gym with Jeff, but he was feeling fairly comfortable at home and wanted to skip it.  Good thing, since Russ called me soon after wanting to get drinks to unwind from a 13 hour day.  We went to  urlLink Tap House , he got dinner and I got a liquid dinner of an Emerald City Tea and a Manhattan.  I pretty much ordered the tea (vodka, gin, rum, midori, pineapple, sprite) because it already looked like Russ and I were on a date, so I had to get something fruity and served in a hurricane glass.  The Manhattan was used to bring up my testosterone levels afterward.  We had a good discussion and I'm glad I skipped working out.  I can always go a bit harder tonight.

      Kat and I had quite a relaxing and enjoyable weekend, if I may say so myself.  Originally, we had planned to go to  urlLink Dahlia Lounge  for dinner on Friday, but we both had a hard week and figured we wouldn't be up for such a nice dinner.  Instead, we ended up going to  urlLink Wasabi Bistro  and had some of the best sushi available in Western Washington.  We tried two of their signature rolls, the Spicy 101 and the Belltown.  Other than an overabundance of mayo on the Spicy 101, the meal was great.  Kat had a craving for edamame and that was satisfied by the complementary bowl served with every dinner.  

Much of Saturday morning was spent lounging around my apartment, but it was definitely not a waste of time.  Much of the afternoon was spent at Starbucks:  Kat doing work, me just playing around on the internet.  That evening, we made the  urlLink first meal in her new townhome .  We made spinach and cheese ravioli, fresh bread and a mixed greens salad.  All in all, very enjoyable.  Before we could make dinner, however, I had to put together the table and chairs we would need to eat off!  I've gotten pretty good at putting together Ikea furniture, so it didn't take too long.  

Sunday saw me fighting with my server for a good part of the afternoon and then having dinner at Kat's parents.  We played a dominos game called Mexican Train and then had a lovely filet dinner.  Her dad and I did most of the talking, but I think everyone enjoyed themselves.

      It's Fifteen Minute Photoshop® time!  

Basically, my bedroom is not in the most optimal configuration.  Both of my tall bookshelves are covering up one window completely and part of another window.  So, I started thinking about alternative arrangements.  Knowning me, I couldn't just visualize this or write it out on a sheet paper, I decided to measure and model my room in Photoshop.  

   

It's pretty hard to see on the left, but there is a long window there.  The upper left red line is another window.  The red line on the right is the bathroom door.  Here is my suggested layout:  

   

This clears both windows (since the dresser fits underneath the window and the sides of the bed are not against the bed) and seems like a good idea.  Bah, no time to do it tonight.

      I've been wrestling with hardware issues for about four days now.  That is what I get for naming a server fireball!  Basically, the machine that has been my internet router, NAT box, development web server, database server, RDP proxy has gone through quite a few upgrades.  It originally was my old overclocking desktop (thus, ""fireball"") running a 300 MHz Celeron.  It was upgraded to a 500 MHz PIII and it currently has a 700 MHz Duron.  A month or so ago, I bought a new 120 GB drive for my desktop (thanks,  urlLink Slickdeals !) and last week I finally got around to putting my old 30 GB drive into fireball.  

The problems started then.  Since the 30 GB drive was already in my desktop, I decided to install OpenBSD 3.4 on the drive before transferring it to the server.  That install went smoothly, but the drive would not boot when I transferred it.  I figured it just didn't like the transfer, so I reinstalled OpenBSD while in fireball.  When I tried to boot after the second install, the bootloader would come up with crap like ""@$%&@#$&*@#$#$%!@#(&(^%"".  After 45 minutes of playing around with the bootloader, the BIOS and the boot sequence, I finally figured out that it wouldn't boot unless the drive was the primary on the IDE chain.  Ok, finally got the new drive up and running!  When installing OBSD, my first steps are to install the ports tree, tcsh, vim, the source and add 'mbibik' as a user.  I got as far as compiling tcsh static when the machine just froze, hard.  I figured, whatever, just a random lockup.   Nope, anytime I taxed the processor, the machine would freeze.  Obviously (at least to me), this seemed like a heat issue.  I opened the case to check out the CPU fan, but it's a fairly small (AKA cramped) case so I couldn't see the fan behind the power supply.  I monitored the CPU temp and it never seemed to get into dangerous territory.   

I gave up at this point and told Russell the internet would be down for awhile (no server, no NAT, no internet).  I started to play with it again, but there isn't much you can do when the damned thing freezes every 15 minutes!  I gave up trying to install tcsh, vim, etc and just started surfing the net from my desktop.  Oddly enough, it didn't lock up.  At this point, I realized that interactive activities such as installing or compiling are probably accessing the disk more than just using the box as a router (which would only access the disk to periodically write logs).  I switched back to the old drive, and all is well.  Too bad my 30 GB drive is fried!

      I should have posted this as soon as I woke up this morning, but I can never seem to get going until 1.5 hours after I wake up.  Unless I wake up late, I will kill 1.5 hours every morning.  Granted, I consider my drive to work to be killed time simply because I am nowhere near fully awake and thus I drive by instinct.  Listening to commercials the entire way there is not uncommon, simply because I am not paying attention whatsoever.  Anyway, the post.  

The remembered dream from last night consisted of some sort of party.  It was possibly a party for me, or just a party in general.  I believe it was a party for me since I was given a car (an Audi TT, or at least the shell of one.   Someone said the rest would be in next week.  Odd choice of car since I do not and have never wanted a TT.) and there was an interesting gag gift.  Basically, someone took all of my prized possesions, which curiously included a house, shrunk them down and locked them in a glass case for everyone to look at.  All throughout the party I never noticed this case.  Once everyone had left, it finally revealed itself and of course I tried to pry it open to retreive my things!  It was a long case, probably 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and high.  The case was in segments, each with a sealed door.  After attempting to pry each door open, the last segment contained what looked like just a piece of yellow paper.  This door opened, and out flew a few miniature (fruit fly-sized) bees!  I'm not allergic nor phobic of bees, but I am not a fan.  For some reason, my mind told me that an ex-girlfriend, Emily, had done all of this.  Made no sense!

      Tis the time to start questioning my health.  Let's just say that for a past few months I've been having some odd issues for someone my age.  Just today, I had a serious headache kick in around 2:00 PM.  At first, it seemed to be another caffeine-based headache, but my caffeine intake has been quite minimal lately.  Instead of trying to fight it, I just called it a day and went home to rest.  Though I didn't feel tired until the headache kicked in and I've been getting adequate sleep, I ended up taking a 2.5 hour nap.  I'm still feeling a bit groggy.  Let's just chalk all of these problems to stress and not enough exercise (at least lately) and hope they all go away.  Ignore it; it will go away.

      Procrastinating between posts requires a Herculean effort to catch up.   Sigh.  

Well, last weekend I went back to Detroit for the second time in three weeks.  The main reason for going back was to attend the  urlLink auto show  and to see friends and family.  I arrived around 6 AM, rented a car, drove back to Livonia and just fell down dead in my bed.  Once noon rolled around, my aunt and I went to the Plymouth Ice Show ( urlLink image gallery ) and just hung out for a bit.  The ice sculptures cannot really be considered art, though some of the pieces showed some technical skill and creativity.  Also, art doesn't usually melt after two weeks...  It was cold enough for my body to shut down blood flow to my hands, so much so that I had difficulty using keys to get back into the car to get warm.  

The rest of the evening was spent with Chris.  We hit Twelve Oaks to grab some  urlLink Panera  (they really need to open one here in Washington:  fresh and chewy breads, sharp cheeses and choice cuts of meat make a great sandwich) and then sat around his place until the Chris and Lindsay engagement party ( urlLink image gallery ) started.  It was a laid back affair consisting of wine and beer and conversation.  This was the first party I've been to with Megan, Iren and Lindsday where they didn't go on a 1.5 hour tangent about their childhood, a discussion which no one else can participate in.  No offense girls, just don't do that again!  I talked to Marty for a bit and his opening bit was classic Marty:  

Ma: ""Have you ever watched Twin Peaks?"" 

Mi: ""Not really, a few episodes, but I know you are a big fan."" 

Ma: ""So why did you go to Snoqualmie then?"" 

My first reaction was that this was just Marty being Marty (if you know him, you know what I mean.  Otherwise, you aren't going to meet him, so don't worry about it), and then I realized that Twin Peaks was filmed in Washington, near a waterfall and then it clicked.  I didn't feel like defending my choice to visit Snoqualmie for a non-Twin Peaks reason and Marty was just trying to show that he has been following my site.  Casey, one of the Northvillians that Chris used to hang out with every week back in high school, was also at the party.  By the eighth beer, he was becoming quite the extrovert.  He knew what he was doing, so he was enjoying the party laughing at him whilst he laughed inside.  

The next morning was the auto show ( urlLink image gallery ) with my dad and grandpa.  Honestly and unfortunately, I wasn't terribly impressed with the show this year.  That shouldn't be much of a surprise since this is the first year where I've been in the actual market for a car.  Previously, I was most excited about the exotic concept cars but now I want to see vechicles that are in showrooms that I can and want to purchase.  Since I just recently purchased a car, I was looking toward the future, toward what should be my next car.  Based on the fact that the Focus is a three-year purchase, that will put my next round at the summer of 2006.  Considering that I should be able to afford a much nicer car, I was looking at the BMW M3 and the Audi S4 as possibilities.  I took many pictures of each, and got a good feel inside and out for the look of the cars.  The M3 has a terribly dated interior and it will be redesigned within the next 18 months.  The redesign could take the car in any direction, basically invalidating any observation of the current model.  The S4 has a delicious interior and the exterior styling is sedate enough yet still sporty.  While this car is a sedan, the back seat leg room is laughable at best.  With the drivers seat fully back, I could barely fit in the S4.  In contrast, I had plenty of leg room in the Infiniti G35 coupe, though head room was an issue there.  Hopefully by the time I am completely fed up with the Focus, a new car will hit my target requirements: 

0-60 MPH  

Mature styling, inside and out (no more thoughts of the STi or Evo) 

High  urlLink build quality  (Odd, I didn't realize that Audi was so far down the list...) 

Ample room for 4 

More to come 

I wholeheartedly recommend the Infiniti site for  urlLink car comparison .  Their tool pulls in just about every specification you need for comparing cars.  

Ok, enough for one post.

      I've spent so much time on this site now that I cannot remember where I came from to get to it (No, I can't just hit back in my browser since I open almost all new links as a tab in  urlLink Mozilla ), but it was probably  urlLink Slashdot .  



Anyway, after having debated for a few years in high school, I learned a few terms for debate tactics, but here is an  urlLink entire site  with terms for each fallacy.  Honestly, I must have observed all of these at one time or another.  A few are extremely frustrating because it is almost as hard to explain the fallacy as it is to fight in the debate.  Some examples are  urlLink burden of proof ,  urlLink confusing cause and effect  (seems easy to explain, just try with some people!), and  urlLink straw man .  I will admit that I have used a handful of these fallacies as well, but I usually know I am using them.  They are only used when I do not have quite enough evidence to back up my clain so I attempt to hoodwink someone with a fallacy while I think of better evidence.  If someone catches me in the fallacy, now I can give an offical term for the fallacy to show that I genuinely knew what I was doing.

      I believe George Carlin said it best:  



Here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?  



You simply do not need ten. The list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten. Here's what happened:  



About 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that God had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.  



Well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10? Why not 9 or 11? I'll tell you why- because 10 sound official. Ten sounds important! Ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed). So having ten commandments was really a marketing decision! It is clearly a bullshit list. It's a political document artificially inflated to sell better. I will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical. I am going to use the Roman Catholic version because those were the ones I was taught as a little boy.  



Let's start with the first three:  



I AM THE LORD THY GOD THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE GODS BEFORE ME  



THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN  



THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH  



Right off the bat the first three are pure bullshit. Sabbath day? Lord's name? strange gods? Spooky language! Designed to scare and control primitive people. In no way does superstitious nonsense like this apply to the lives of intelligent civilized humans in the 21st century. So now we're down to 7. Next:  



HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER  



Obedience, respect for authority. Just another name for controlling people. The truth is that obedience and respect shouldn't be automatic. They should be earned and based on the parent's performance. Some parents deserve respect, but most of them don't, period. You're down to six.  



Now in the interest of logic, something religion is very uncomfortable with, we're going to jump around the list a little bit.  



THOU SHALT NOT STEAL  



THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS  



Stealing and lying. Well actually, these two both prohibit the same kind of behavior- dishonesty. So you don't really need two you combine them and call the commandment ""thou shalt not be dishonest"". And suddenly you're down to 5.  



And as long as we're combining I have two others that belong together:  



THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTRY  



THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE  



Once again, these two prohibit the same type of behavior. In this case it is marital infidelity. The difference is- coveting takes place in the mind. But I don't think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else's wife because what is a guy gonna think about when he's waxing his carrot? But, marital infidelity is a good idea so we're gonna keep this one and call it ""thou shalt not be unfaithful"". And suddenly we're down to four.  



But when you think about it, honesty and infidelity are really part of the same overall value so, in truth, you could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments and give them simpler language, positive language instead of negative language and call the whole thing ""thou shalt always be honest and faithful"" and we're down to 3.  



THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR""S GOODS  



This one is just plain fuckin' stupid. Coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going! Your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays ""o come o ye faithful"", and you want one too! Coveting creates jobs, so leave it alone. You throw out coveting and you're down to 2 now- the big honesty and fidelity commandment and the one we haven't talked about yet:  



THOU SHALT NOT KILL  



Murder. But when you think about it, religion has never really had a big problem with murder. More people have been killed in the name of god than for any other reason. All you have to do is look at Northern Ireland, Cashmire, the Inquisition, the Crusades, and the World Trade Center to see how seriously the religious folks take thou shalt not kill. The more devout they are, the more they see murder as being negotiable. It depends on who's doin the killin' and who's gettin' killed. So, with all of this in mind, I give you my revised list of the two commandments:  



Thou shalt always be honest and faithful to the provider of thy nookie.  



and  



Thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course they pray to a different invisible man than you.  



Two is all you need; Moses could have carried them down the hill in his fuckin' pocket. I wouldn't mind those folks in Alabama posting them on the courthouse wall, as long as they provided one additional commandment:  



Thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.

      I haven't posted an actual update in far too long.  Let's dial back the Wheel of Time™.  

I finally moved off the Daily servers for both my email and my web hosting.  The email wasn't a big deal since Yahoo is free and I just forward everything from umich anyway.  Keep emailing me at mbibik at umich dot edu, since I might not stay with Yahoo.  The web hosting, on the other hand, was a big deal.  My gallery was taking up at least a gig and no host would charge less than $39/month for that much space.  Well, I found a free host for most of my site and then I'm hosting the galleries at home (thus the mbibik.dyndns.org URL).   No, I can't tell you where I'm hosting, but you can sort of figure it out if you are smart.  

Kat and I have been up and down lately, but she is in Italy for two weeks so hopefully things will improve (absense makes the heart, blah blah blah).  Unfortunately, she had a slight hiccup with her flight plans!  Her flight from Seattle to Chicago left on time, but due to weather it couldn't land and had to circle for an extra two hours.  This made her miss the connecting flight from Chicago to Rome!  Her sister flew in from North Carolina so they could fly together to Rome so she skipped the flight to be with Kat.  Now they are both trying to find another flight to Rome.  The next direct flight that is available isn't until Saturday night and American Airlines keeps telling them to fly to London and then home for a standby flight to Rome.  No matter what, I would be very upset.   You can't really get pissed since there is no control over the weather, but very upset nontheless.  

My car is really pissing me off lately.   Purchased on 06/27/2003 for about $18k and 8 months later it is only worth $10k.  I still owe about that much!  Anyway, it looks like I haven't posted about my car problems over the past few months.  My CEL (check engine light) came on during normal driving.  Nothing seemed amis, but I made a service appointment anyway.  By the time the appointment arrived, the CEL was off.  They took it and ran some tests anyway.  They replaced a fuel hose and said the car should be fine.  I took it home that night and the CEL went back on the very next day!  I waited a couple weeks before making another appointment.  During those few weeks, the CEL would go on for a couple days then go back off for awhile.  Nothing really seemed wrong with the car until I checked my fuel logs.  The car was getting 17 MPG!  This car is rated for 27 MPG, so something was definitely borked.  I took it in and this time the CEL was on when they received it.  They replaced an 02 sensor and again said the car was fine.  Well, I completely grannied the next tank of gas and got 22 MPG.  Not bad, but not good either.  I went back to my normal driving style and I'm still getting 17 MPG.  I could be driving a WRX for that sort of gas mileage!  I talked to the service tech and he claims he has seens Focii get 17 MPG and there was no solution.  Great.  

I finally just decided to ignore the gas mileage since I'm not driving that much anyway.  About two weeks ago, I was simply changing a preset on my radio and it decides to completely freak out.  Now, it goes through this cycle of playing 0.5 seconds of music then turning off for 1.5 seconds, constantly rebooting.  What make its even more annoying is that you have a 0.2 second window while the radio is off to hit the power button so that it will stay off.  I'm sure I can fix it by pulling the plug (disconnect the battery), I just haven't gotten around to it.

      Setting:   A Gameworks or some sort of gaming facility.  Lots of old people, dimly lit, similar to a casino in that respect.  Basically, it had the feel of a Gameworks, casino and bowling alley combined.  

First scene:  I'm sitting down and playing some sort of matching game, seems like Mastermind, with quarters.  An older lady approaches from nowhere and demands to know where my gamer card is (If you have been to Gameworks or Dave & Busters, you know that instead of using quarters, you get a credit card of sorts that you can put money on.  I show a pocket full of quarters, implying that I'm just playing with quarters and she storms off.   She returns about 5 minutes later and hands me a large stack of gamer chips (4 $25, 2 $10, 2 $5, 4 $1) and a fist fill of Twizzlers.  The look she gives me as she walks off was, ""I've been in your place before, kid.  Have some fun and enjoy the sugar!"".  Possibly she thought I was poor since I only showed about 5 dollars with in quarters.  I vaguely remember winning a lot of money on the Mastermind game and then being given a tour of the facility.  The man in charge was giving the tour and reminded me of  urlLink Tom Poston  from the Newhart show, but with a suit that Rod Roddy would wear.   Well, a suit he would have worn, since he  urlLink died  of breast cancer.  During the tour, I remember passing by a small room in the back with mirrors on the walls and a rainbow motif adorning the ceiling.  He said that was in case anyone felt like dancing and could also be rented out.  Oddly enough, it was empty and the lights were off.  I can only imagine how those rainbows would look with the full house lights!  I know I would want to shake my groove thang, and probably go suck on a popsicle or eat some sausage.  

Second scene:  The dream gets fuzzy for a bit, but I remember after the tour there was this one counter way in the back with no one around it.  The person running it is none other than Beth Manoongian, an ""acquaintance"" from school.  This game was a trivia game with a twist.  The questions are extremely difficult but the prize for answering a single question runs in the millions of dollars.  I decide to give it a shot, hoping that Beth will help me out a little bit.  As she pulls the question from a long box of cards, she places it on ledge face down in front of me, then gets a phone call.  While she isn't watching, I try to see what the answer is, but can't quite make it out.  It looks like ""Yeh"" to me backwards.  The question was something like ""What is the beach on Jo Beach?"".  Sort of a trick question, but I thought I already had the answer.   I hem and haw for a bit, then exclaim ""Yeh!"".  The answer was actually ""Lev"", which doesn't make sense to me in the dream or in the waking world.  Since playing the game is free, I have her pull out another card.  By this time, someone else has joined me at the counter.  This person seemed to be between 18-22 years old, male, dark hair, reminded me of a frat boy.  The next question wasn't even a question, it was something along the lines of ""(SomeForeignName) is furious.""  I think the riddle was that you had to figure out the country that would give out a name like that then give the translation for ""furious"".  The random guy and I looked at each other trying to figure it out and then I woke up.  

I should rent out my brain for studies into the abnormal.

      So the first inline hockey game was yesterday!   Lee and I got there 1.5 hours early so that we could sign up for the league, meet the team and do a little bit of practicing.  The facility is fairly ghetto, located in what looks like an old warehouse.  It is seperated into a little practice field for soccer, the inline rink, then a larger soccer field.  The rink itself is in good condition with an interesting plastic flooring that reminds me of the plastic used for milk crates or toddlers blocks (not the shiny kind).    We only got about 20 minutes of practice in, but it was tiring.  I know that when I got off the rink at the start of the game, I was drenched in sweat.   

We ended up losing 5-4, but I scored twice and Lee scored as well!  We both received praise during and after the game which made us both feel a bit better about playing.  Everyone seems very nice and laid back which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Our first practice is tomorrow (yes, we had a game before we practiced) so hopefully my sore knee and arm feel better!

       urlLink New Scientist :  It looks like the ""fact"" that mammals do not produce new eggs after birth may be incorrect.  With a study done on mice, it appears that the number of living eggs decreases too rapidly for the number of eggs available at birth to persist until menopause.  To test if new eggs were created, an ovary from a normal mouse was inplanted into a mouse that was genetically modified to generate a glowing protein in all new cells.  After transplant, eggs were observed with the glowing protein, practically confirming that new eggs are created after birth.

      Well, I just joined an inline hockey league!  We have games every Tuesday, starting tomorrow, for 12 weeks at  urlLink Arena Sports .  Lee introduced me to the team and we are both going to be on the core roster.  I was originally on the substitute list but someone from the core team dropped out.  

So, I've played a lot of street hockey, but I've never played on a team or in any sort of organization fashion.  The closest I've come to organization was playing at Elbel Field in Ann Arbor where they kept a list of players.  First come, first serve, so as a person decided to take a break, the next person on the list got to hop in.  That pales in comparison to a real league, so I cannot even imagine what I'm in for tomorrow night.  I've watched enough hockey in my life to know what to do!  Right, I'll be just fine.  No worries.   I'm going to die.  

Anyway, Russ and I decided that hockey is the most expensive game to play that does not require an animal (polo, cockfighting, etc).  I already owned skates and a stick, I didn't buy top of the line gear and I still spent $435 dollars.  Things I needed: helmet, elbow pads, cup, girdle, shin pads, inline pants and a hockey bag.  I better play this game for more than a season...  I'm a dork, so of course there are  urlLink pictures .

      Consumerist Whore:  So awhile back, I sold my GameCube, memory card, Metroid Prime (wanted to write ""Metroit Prime"", too much time spent in the Motor City, I guess), Super Mario Sunshine and Prince of Persia to GameStop for a whopping $101.  When you sell used games and consoles, they give you store credit.  This credit comes in the form of a receipt with a unique alphanumeric.  When the cashier gives you said receipt, he/she is supposed to impart the words of wisdom ""DO NOT LOSE THIS.""  Well, I lost it!  Luckily, I was dorky enough to write down said alphanumeric and GameSpot was able to reissue the receipt.  Let's see how long it takes before I lose it again.  

Anyway, the point of this post was that I went to the mall to get the reissued receipt and ended up going shopping for myself.  I ended up buying two pairs of stain, spill and wrinkle resistant pants at the Gap and three shirts over at Express.  When I went to the get the receipt reissued, the manager said that he woudl probably call me on Tuesday with the reissue since he has to call corporate and they are closed on the weekend.  Turns out, they were open today so he told me to come pick up the receipt.  Another trip to the mall, and we all know what that means... more shopping.   I hadn't run into J. Crew or Banana Republic since I was in a bit of a rush last night.  Ended up buying my second pair of jeans, making that two pairs purchased in the past 8 months, my first pairs in at least 8 years!  J. Crew jeans are just about the only ones that fit me even close to well.  Jamie and I must have spent at least two hours looking for that first pair.  Actually, I think that only J. Crew works for jeans, Gap works for casual pants and Kenneth Cole works for dress pants.  Anyway, I ended up spending $50 for an undershirt and two pairs of boxers at Banana Republic.  Even I realize that's a waste of money, but they were cute and everyone needs underwear, right?  Mmmm,  underwear...

      So, by now you have probably heard that Nintendo's next handheld will have two screens and be called the DS (D = Dual/Double S = Screen). Take a look at this  urlLink mockup  posted to Gizmodo.  The angled design immediately screams to me ""This is better because it is different!"", but just think about the ergnomics.  Hold your hands in front of you as if you were trying to hold something a bit smaller than a paperback book, lengthways.  You don't curl your wrists outward and your fingers upward, as you would have to with this design.  I can see a large number of young gamers developing carpal tunnel if this design got the green light.  (I'm going to refrain from jokes about other causes of carpal tunnel in young male gamers.)  

A common question about the Pocket PC Phone that I carry around is ""Can it play games?""  Well, the answer is yes, but why bother?  The overall form factor is wrong, requiring you to interlace your fingers to hold the device with two hands.  Additionally, there is a directional pad and four buttons, but the pad only supports the four cardinal directions (not diagonals) and two of the buttons are toward the top of the screen.  Basically, I wouldn't even try playing pong on this thing.  Hell, I have nethack install on it and even that is impossible to play.

      Woohoo, go  urlLink Markko !  He only one a single stage of the entire rally, but ""slow and steady wins the race"".  Ok, in all actuality, having your strongest competitor get slapped with a  urlLink 5 minute penalty  wins the race.  If you don't want to read the link, basically Petter Solberg had some electrical issues before the start of a stage.  He and his codriver tried to push the car uphill to make it to the starting line in time.  There were already 4 minutes late, giving them a 40 second penalty when the officials realized they received help from the spectators to reach the starting line.  That tacked on an additional 5 minute penalty eventhough neither the driver nor codriver asked for the help.  With a final time difference of 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds from Markko Martin, Solberg would have won.  As Russ said, he probably wouldn't have pushed so hard if it wasn't for that 5 minute and 40 second penalty.

      Dream Update:  The dream from last night concerned me entering some sort of car show.  The show was held in a building similar to Cobo Hall where the North American International Auto Show is held.  The first part of the dream is quite fuzzy, but it involved Jeff, Russ and I driving quite a long distance from home to the show, trailering my show car.  The car was a fairly sedate blue; brighter than Ford Racing blue but not as bright as Subaru World Rally blue.  I have no idea what type of car it was, though my mind told me it was an Acura RSX.  I'm not even sure what sort of car show it was, but I knew that I had to perform something.  Possibly just drive it around for show, possibly drag race it, possibly drift it, who knows!  

After we got to the show, there was quite a bit of time before I had to drive, so we walked around.  As we walked around, I realized that I had forgotten the keys to the show car!  Since it was trailered there, I didn't need the keys.  Oddly enough, I found out that I was carrying one of my old keys from the Michigan Daily and it worked as a master key for the entire showroom building.  Again, oddly enough, all of the mens bathrooms were closed so all of the womens bathrooms became co-ed.    While Jeff, Russ and I were walking back down to the parking garage so that we could go get the keys to the show car, we ran into a group of about six people.  We were in a small hallway at a bend, so it was a tight fit to get all 9 people through.  The groups sort of collided, then the six people swarmed us.  My first thought was to check our wallets.  They didn't actually steal our wallets, but Jeff had lost all of his IDs and all of his money except for singles.  Just at the end of the altercation, I some how stole back all of Jeff's IDs and a huge stack of money.  I checked my wallet at this point, and it actually had more money in it than before!  At first, I was pleased, then I checked the bills.  A 300 hundred dollar bill?  Another bill that had multiple denominations on it (I remember one that had ""$300"", ""$133"" and ""$16"" all on the same bill)?  Another bill that had some sort of religious message on the back instead of a visual scene?  This was where I woke up.

      I am absolutely amazed by this  urlLink review  of Dawn of the Dead.  Not because it is a bad review, not because it is a funny review, not because the review is dramatically wrong but because this is a review for parents.  This is one of the most gore-filled movies I have ever seen, lots of swearing, some nudity and sexual situations and all of the other great things that give movies an R rating.  There is even a handy table listing issues such as ""Profanity"", ""Nudity/Sex"" and even ""Diversity Issues.""  You would figure that the review would be horribly opposed to anyone young seeing this and especially not making this family affair.  Au contrair, the review is suprisingly positive without a lick of conservative America ""hide your children from this filth"" opinion.  The review even gives discussion topics if this movie is seen as a family!  ""Families who watch this movie might wish to discuss the different approaches taken by the survivors and the range of choices that they make. Are there times when the moral answer is at odds with the instinct to survive? How would you handle this variance?""  I am amazed, and quite proud, of this site.

      I knew the addiction wasn't going to get any better when I would think back to those lovely days when I owned a video game console.  All those levels beat, all those new trophies acquired, all those end-bosses defeated...   I needed a console, and fast!  I ended up using my $101 store credit at GameStop to buy a refurbished PS2 with network adapter and another copy of Gran Turismo 3.  I still had my saved game from when Joe and I co-owned a PS2, so I fired that up.  

Last night, I ended up beating all of the rally levels.  I used the same car for all of the levels:  a heavily modified Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII GSR, putting out about 542 HP.  There are 10 tracks on the rally circuit, 3 races per track and 2, 3 and 5 laps per race.  That means 300 rally laps to complete the entire circuit.  My car couldn't handle as well as most of the rally cars on gravel, but the sheer power got it through those tracks without fault.  On tarmac, the car could handle at least as well as the rally cars and I still had a huge power advantage.  The prize for getting all first places on the 30 different races is the  urlLink Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version .  You'd think a Suzuki would be a horrible prize car, but mine is currently modified to put down 1881 HP!  Top speed is currently 278.9 MPH, nice.

      I am genuinely curious to know, on average, how many people a person knows (basically friends and family) that have committed suicide?  Personally, I believe I only know of one person.  I say believe because I have a very good ability to block out many harmful events.  I only know of one person that committed suicide at my high school during the four years I was there and I didn't actually know the person, so they aren't on my list.  There was a discussion I saw online and some people knew upwards of nine people that had ended their lives.  I guess that high of a number just made me think.  I'm still thinking.

      Car hunt update:  I got to ride along on two test drives today.  I say ride along since I had Jeff drive them for me!  I suck at manual so I didn't feel like embarrassing myself.  First was the '89 Mitsubishi Colt.  The exterior was decent with just a few bit of rust along the faded paint.  The interior, on the other hand, was well aged.  Not well aged like a wine, cheese, or whiskey, but well aged like that a high school cafeteria mom.  Bits of plastic were broken in just about every spot, including the turn indicator.  It was so broken that Jeff could barely get it to work at all.  The engine was in pretty good shape, but the clutch was really soft.  

Next up was the '92 Camaro.  The owner was about 10 minutes late, but all was forgiven when I saw the quality of this car.  There is a slight dent just behind the driver side door that is starting to rust and there is a modicum of rust above the rear passenger wheel well.  Other than that, the vehicle looked practically new!  The interior was a bit worn, but no damage.  The clutch was in good shape, the stereo is brand new, the tires are new, the battery is new and most of the suspension was new.  Needless to say, I was pretty impressed.  It was only an RS, which means that it has 140 HP but 180 lb-ft of torque (and still better than the 130 HP and 135 lb-ft in my Focus!).  Since the car is in such good shape, I really doubt that I will be able to talk him down from the $2,000 price.  

Considering how impressed I was with the car, I called up my insurance agent.  If I add a second car to my policy, it will drop the price on the Focus from $672 to $637.  Full coverage on the Camaro would be $298 and just the basics will get run me $198.  Not that bad at all!  I was originally considering paying for a parking spot in a lot near my apartment, but then I realized that I should be able to park at work.  As long as I swap cars at least once a week and move the cars around every other day, I shouldn't get in trouble from security.  As soon as they say something, I will pay for the lot ($50/month).  

If I don't think of anything I've forgotten and no one else says this is a dumb idea, I think I'm going to buy it on Monday.  I'd love to have it for the weekend, especially while Kat is gone, but I really shouldn't make a rash decision.

It would be cool to say that I owned a Supra, no matter what model year it is.  Both are in fairly decent shape, at least from what I was told.

      I'm looking for a used car!  No, even with all of the problems with the Focus, (which I've since named Sanchez, since the car was made in Mexico and now I can make all sorts of ""Dirty Sanchez"" jokes) I am not thinking of replacing it for a used car.  I'm actually looking for an old manual car so that I can get better with an MT before I get a real car.  I figure, why not spend upwards of $2,000 on a used car, practice driving a manual, then sell it off for upwards of $1,500 rather than spending $1,200 on clutch replacement for a new car?  There is a parking lot a block away from my apartment where I can get a space for only $50/month.  I will put the least amount of insurance on it, so it shouldn't be too expensive of a proposition.

The wheels that the skates came with weren't bad (Labeda Shooters) and the bearings were satisfactory (ABEC 3 rated, the lowest rating but there are worse bearings out there that aren't even rated!).  I had used the wheels quite a bit playing outdoor inline, so they were quite worn down:

      I've been a bad blogger.  I apologize.  Time for Ultra Happy Delight Bullets!



 

 Dream from last night:  I cannot remember the bulk of the dream, but it involved a large number of my friends from both Microsoft and UMich at a presentation of some sort.  Everyone was sitting in rows of chairs waiting for it to start.  I was supposed to drive to this with one of the devs on my team, Matt, but when I got there, he was sitting with Matt Weber.  Just before the presentation started, I remember that I borrowed Jeff's can opener and he needed it back!  I was quite concerned since this was a limited edition can opener.  Oddly enough, there were shelves and shelves of shoe boxes and skiing equipment to the side of the presentation room.  After a frantic search, I finally found the can opener at the bottom of a shoe box.  The can opener was a WRX model in Sonic Yellow, which would explain why I was frantic to find it (the Impreza WRX in Sonic Yellow is a very rare sight).  That doesn't explain why I am having crazy dreams.

 FloorBurn improved to a record of 3-2 after our 6-2 win on Tuesday.  I scored twice, so I'm back as leading scorer.

 Wall of Meat (flag football) is perfect so far at 2-0!  We had a come from behind win on Saturday with our new quarterback, but I can definitely see the team improving from here out.

 I'm getting closer to buying the Camaro.  The owner just needs to get it to pass emissions and then I will almost certainly buy it.

 The NY auto show is tomorrow thus I expect information about the 2005 Subarus to be released tomorrow.  Rumor has it that the WRX will go a complete redesign for the '06 model year, so maybe buying an '05 would be silly.  I don't want to look dated that fast!

      I can't believe I forgot to post this!  So every three months, the  urlLink Puget Sound Blood Center  sends a Bloodmobile to my campus.  I made an appointment for the first time it came around, but had to cancel it due to a meeting conflict.  The second time it came around, I went to donate without an appointment and they were full.  Finally, I got to donate yesterday.  

Since it was my first time donating with them, I had to go through the full screening process, mini interview and all.  Finally, I give blood and they have me lay down for an extra a few minutes afterward since this was my first time with them and all.  The actual process of giving blood went just fine.  As I was laying down resting, my stomach started to feel a bit nauseous.  Suddenly, the nausea got worse and I started to think about asking one of the nurses for something to vomit into.  The next thing I notice, there are three people crowded around me and I've got cold compresses on my neck and chest.  Turns out, I passed out!  I was only out for a few seconds, but it was not a pleasant experience.  Soon after I woke up, I broke out in a cold sweat.  I felt functional about 5 minutes later, but I was definitely tired and out of it for the rest of the day.  I, obviously, skipped my hockey game.

      Katherine and I went to Daniel's Broiler on Lake Union on Thursday night.  We had a $25 gift certificate, but that really doesn't go very far when the entrees are about $40 each!  The hostess treated us just like any other couple having dinner on a Thursday night, but the waiter had a different idea.  It seems that he saw two kids that were in over their heads and thus he didn't expect a large tip.  Since, in his mind, his tip was already shot, he decided to basically treat us like an annoyance.  Since I was out for a nice dinner, I ordered Perrier to start and I made Kat get some Evian even though she is a tap water kind of girl.  He brought us two glasses and two bottles and didn't even offer to pour for us.  I know, I'm getting prissy here, but come on.  While every other table received warm bread and butter before the meal, I had to specifically request it.  When it finally came, our food was ready not 2 minutes later.  When we ordered wine, he acted as if the only grape product we had ever drank was Welch's.  Thanks buddy, I know the basics of wine, and yes I do know that higher altitude wines come from a more concentrated grape.  He got most of our order correct, but he switched how Katherine and I liked our meat (I ordered medium and she ordered medium-rare and he switched them).  Kat has eaten at Daniel's probably ten times and she said this was the first time they didn't offer to cut the meat at the table to show that it was cooked properly.  Maybe he knew he had messed up.  No matter what, our waiter was still not the most annoying part of the evening!  

Soon after we had sat down, a pair of gentlemen were seated directly behind us.  Our backs were mostly turned to them, but Kat could tell that the older of the two, maybe 45-50 years old, was consistently staring at her.  This skeeved her out a bit, but was soon ignored.  After we had finished our entree and started to dig into some creme brulee, our waiter approached carrying two glasses of red wine.  He informed us that the man behind us offered two glasses of his fine Argentinean wine.  We raised our glasses and turned to the man and thanked him.  He said ""Enjoy, or as we would say in Norway, Skord.""  At this point, we felt fairly awkward.  Here was two men that had offered us nice wine and now expected us to at least talk to them.  I basically told Kat to hurry up and drink the wine so we could say a quick word with them and then get the hell out of there!  Kat didn't want to gulp the wine, figuring that would be even more rude.  Eventually, we started to talk to them while we were all still seated.  He asked if we were here on business and when I replied in the negative, he said ""Yes, you two look too romantic for business.""  The older man was doing all the talking and when he informed me that his companion was visiting from Norway, I just assumed that he couldn't speak English very well.  The older man then complemented Kat on her looks and said something about us being an attractive couple.  Kat and were both obviously nervous and annoyed, but we were still stuck talking.  The man finally said something about his wife and then started babbling.  I couldn't understand a word he was saying and Katherine was having trouble hearing, so we basically turned back to our table to finish the wine and escape.  After drinking the last drop, we got up to leave and I approached the man to at least shake his hand.  After shaking, he gently held on to my hand and placed his other hand on my upper arm, basically trapping me there.  He asked if we enjoyed the wine, if we would like to sit down and have another glass.  I told him we had to leave and we basically fled.  At this point, I heard his companion speak and he said something in accent-free English.  He understood the language, he was just being quiet because he was obviously embarrassed by what was going on!  Kat was, understandbly, a bit disturbed by the whole situation.  Ugh.

      Speaking of cars, I totally forgot to say that I officially own the Camaro now!  I took a few  urlLink crappy pictures ; I will try to get some better ones in the sun soon.  So far, I've only driven the car in the parking garage at work and a few blocks around my building.  I am still pretty horrible with the manual, but I'm getting better.  

Last night, Jeff and I took it out for a little spin.  Everything was going fine until I stopped at a stop sign and just couldn't seem to get the car going.  I kept stalling and stalling and stalling.  It felt very weird to me since I was giving it a ton of gas, it just didn't seem like enough.  After about 12 tries I finally got the car going!  It still seemed to be acting up because the revs were so low.  I stopped at the next stop sign and had the same issue!  Finally Jeff hopped in, played with the shifter and turns out, I was in third gear!  I'm just surprised that I actually got it to go that one time.  Oh well, Jeff said the shifter is fairly narrow and thus it's hard to tell which gear you are in.  I just think I am dumb and that is one more thing I will pay attention to when driving stick.

      My take on GMail.  

Ok, I've only been using it for a short while, but I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.  The first issue is that all email is sorted by ""conversations"", which is basically what everyone but Microsoft and GMail call threads.  For those of you that don't know what that means, a thread/conversation is just what it sounds like, a collection of email messages relating to a specific topic.  On the most basic level, a conversation is an original message and any replies to that message.  Certain mail clients assign a thread ID and thus you can change the message subject and it will still be a part of the original thread/conversation.  Either GMail or Yahoo doesn't support thread ID because I changed the subject on a thread and GMail started a new ""conversation"".  



There are a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which is interesting for a webmail client.  Seeing as I used pine for my email for 6 years, I'm quite used to navigating my email with a keyboard...  in pine!  Using it in gmail isn't as easy as I expected.  There are keyboard shortcuts for navigating various messages and conversations, but very basic actions, like cancelling the composition of a message, has to be done by mouse.  I do love that the keyboard shortcut for reporting spam is the excalamation key...  it just goes so well with most spam: ""Ge.t a m.a$siv3 mem.b3r! buttercup obtuse bingo cxoiuqweijfd4klhjd7""  My natural response is ""!"".  



GMail has a concept of ""All mail"" and ""archive"".  The main action for all emails is to ""archive"" it.  It doesn't place the message in the trash, it doesn't move it to a specific folder, it just moves the email out of your inbox.  The only way to view archived mails is to use the All Mail view.  All Mail shows any mail in your inbox, your sent mail ""folder"" and anything you have archived.  It does not show any spam or trash emails.  



Instead of supporting folders like most email clients (web or desktop), GMail has introduced the concept of ""Labels"".  Well, I shouldn't say introduced, but this is the first time I've seen it in relation to an email client.  Instead of storing a conversation (see above) in various default or unique folders, you can assign one or more labels to the conversation.  Let's say that you wanted to save all conversations from a specific person in a specific folder and you wanted to save all conversations about a specific topic in a specific folder, what happens if your specifics collide?  Do you try to decide which folder takes presidence?  With labels, you can give the conversation labels for both the sender and the topic.  Like most folder views, there is a list of labels so you can jump to the list of all conversations with a specific label.  



GMail also supports filters which works hand in hand with labels.  You can filter on sender, receiver, subject, words in the body and words missing from the body.  The actions you can take are skip inbox (meaning it places the mail into the archive (see above)), apply a specific label or move it directly to the trash.  You cannot mark anything as spam through the filter.



One little feature that I saw in their help files but they did not actually implement related to attachments.  Instead of showing the common and generic paper clip icon to denote an attachment, GMail would use an icon to represent the file type of the attachment.  If it was a PDF, the common PDF icon would be used, etc.  I tested this out, and it's just a paper clip.  Shucky darn.  



Overall, I'm sure that I will get used to conversation view, labels and archive and be very happy with my free 1000 MB webmail client harnessing Google!

      Do you want to try out GMail?  Since GMail is still in a test period, acceptance is by invitation only.  I received my invitation through Blogger, but now that I am a user I can invite two more people!  The first two to contact me get dibs.  (Note:  If you ask via email, I only check once a day and thus it would be faster to txt/IM/call me.  If you email me right away yet I get two phone calls after your email was sent, you ain't getting GMail from me.)

      Angry Cell Phone Customer Trashes Verizon Store 

POSTED: 11:43 a.m. EDT May 14, 2004  



FARGO, N.D. -- A man who said he was fed up with his cellular phone service went to a Fargo mall and started hurling phones across a store, striking an employee and causing more than $2,000 in damage, authorities said.   



Jason Perala, 22, of Fargo, told The Forum newspaper that he planned only to yell at employees at Verizon Wireless.   



""Then I just lost it,"" he said. ""I just started grabbing computers and phones and throwing them. I just destroyed the place. ... I kind of regret that I did it, but I hope my message got across."" 

   

Police said Perala took off his shirt and put on safety glasses before throwing around computers, phones and other items.   



One employee was struck in the shoulder by a phone before he and other workers dashed into an office, locked the door and called police, Sgt. Kevin Volrath said. Other businesses in the West Acres mall lowered their steel security gates during Thursday's incident.   



Perala was arrested without incident and jailed on charges of felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor simple assault.

       urlLink Karamazov : ""He also discusses his belief that men only practice love for their fellow man out of a belief in God and the immortality of their soul. If they did not believe, Ivan says, than there would exist no incentive or reason for them to practice love and kindness. If they do not believe, then the only motive for action would logically be self-interest. ""  

Is that a truism?  Do you believe that, in a mentality lacking love and kindness, the only logical conclusion would be that all actions would be driven by self-interest?  The implication here is that self-interest is inherently a negative characteristic.  Is it not possible that, while looking out for yourself, you can also look out for others?  The man that helps and cares for others may draw greater fortune to himself.  By looking out for others, you are in a way looking out for yourself?  

Honestly, there is very little that I do that does not benefit myself in some way.  I doubt there have been more than two cases in the past five years where I have done something that I did not think would ultimately benefit myself.  If I make a sacrifice at work to help someone out, I believe that this action will be remembered and either they would help me out or I would gain better standing in their mind.  If I was to perform community service, it would partially be because I could talk about it later and have others think highly of me.  I'm selfish, but sometimes it benefits others.

      Gah, I can't believe I forgot to post this earlier!  So, on Monday, I had a cashier ask me about my age.  Well, it happened again on Thursday!  I was going to Sports Authority to buy an ankle brace for Kat when it happened.  I picked out the brace and headed to the first available cashier.  I paid with a credit card and had to use one of the electronic signature readers.  She told me to keep my card out for signature validation so I also pulled out my drivers license.  My signature never looks right on this electronic devices so I did it just in case.  I guess the cashier looked at my birthdate because when she handed my cards back to me:  



""Are you 23, 24?"" 

""23, why, do I seem older, younger?"" 

""More mature."" 

""Any reason?"" 

I'm 21 and guys our age seem younger.  You dress well, like you made it somewhere, you seem established.""  



The funny thing is, I was wearing a long-sleeve jersey material shirt (Kenneth Cole, but she couldn't tell that), Gap slacks and black Puma sneakers!  I definitely wasn't sporting ""mature"" looking attire.  Oh well.

Anyway, during the daily Jeff-and-Mike lunch extravaganza, something a bit humorous happened.  Jeff and I have a pretty set list of restaurants we go to (Quizno's, Qdoba, Chipotle, Ribeye, Nasai Teriyaki, Red Robin, Matt's Famous, Arby's, Taj Palace, Yen Ching, etc) and some of the places have started to remember us.  Today at one of the usuals, my order number was 29.  The cashier said ""29, close to 30...   are you over 30?"".  I had remembered from a previous conversation that she said she had been out of school for 10 years and just got her degree last year so I assumed she was about 30 though she looked not a day over 21.  My response was ""No, a bit lower"", giving her a thumbs down motion.  

""29?"" 

""No."" 

""27?"" 

""Nope, lower."" 

At this point, she just looked at me, scared to give another incorrect answer.  I held up two fingers, said ""23"" and transitioned to three fingers.  She was quite flabergasted and made some commented about how I looked so much older while she looked so much younger saying that people don't think of her as a day older than 20, 19 even!  

Funny stuff.

      Haha, I'm a tool.  Just today, Kat and I went to Big Apple Bagels to grab a quick lunch before we both headed off to work (yes, working on a Saturday).  I ordered my usual, a Roma Italian sub and a 32oz Diet Coke.  We were both a bit tired today but I believe I was the one with worse coordiation.  While reaching for my drink, I slightly nudged it.  Thinking I was about to knock it off the table, I made a quick grab for it, hoping to save it.  Instead, I increased the drinks velocity and redirected its destination vector directly toward Kat.  Needless to say, I absolutely drenched her in 32oz of Diet Coke.  Thankfully, she wasn't too upset.  I tried to clean up as best I could, but she was basically covered and nothing could be done.  We quickly finished our meal outside and then went home.  Minus 50 points for me (for the obvious) and plus 50 points for her (or not freaking out).

      Hmm, power to weight ratios, one of the most important aspects of any car.  The Focus only has 130 HP but it only weighs 2551 pounds and has 135 ft-lbs.  The Camaro, on the other hand has only 140 HP and weighs 3103 pounds but has 180 ft-lbs.  A few calculations later give 19.62 pounds-per-HP and 18.90 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Focus and 22.16 pounds-per-HP and 17.24 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Camaro.  The Focus is faster than the Camaro but the Camaro has better low-end acceleration?  Weird.

      Nothing quite like slogging through an array of websites to find out the recommended fuel for your new crappy car.  Considering that the car was produced in 1992, trying to find information about it online is interesting.  Most of the sites that have info are either all-encompasing sites that cover a certain aspect of all cars (safety info, for example), or they are some enthusiast site just for that car or type of car (thus a third generation Camaro).  I finally found that my base V6 engine only requires regular unleaded fuel.  I know the Chevy used to have a 4-cyl Camaro and that would obviously take regular so I figured it was possible that the V6 was mapped for midgrade (89 octane).  Nope, just 87 octane.

      As a kid, I absolutely hated a warm pillow.  I would have difficulty falling asleep because by the time I had rested enough to almost fall asleep, the heat of my pillow would annoy me and wake me up.  I would either flip the pillow or sleep on the other end.  In other words, the average pillow had four sectors.  By the time I was done with all four, the original sector had probably cooled down to normal and I could switch to it.  I remember being awake for at least an extra hour some nights because of this.  

I no longer have this problem, otherwise I would run out and buy the  urlLink Chillow !  A small, flat but otherwise pillow-shaped insert, the Chillow acts as a heatsink and radiator.  It makes one side cold and one side a bit warm.  The warmth is absorbed by the pillow proper and dissipated leaving the surface nice and chilly.  Hell, I might buy one anyway!

      Car update:  I'm getting better at the manual seeing as I haven't stalled yet today (a first!).  I've had some compliments including about the exhaust note.  I'm happy.  I'm really started to get used to the upgraded audio.  The bass response is pretty cool and there is a fairly slick steering column (not steering wheel) based audio controller.  I will probably take a picture of it when I do a full photoshoot later.  Basically, it is stalk sticking out from the lower left area of the steering column.  It has a two-way switch for station seeking (while in radio mode) and track seeking (for CD mode), two buttons for volume control and a single button for mode which will switch between presets for radio mode and will switch CDs for CD mode.  I'm getting used to using it.

      Yesterday was my one year anniversary at Microsoft!  Following standard procedure, I brought in a pound of M&Ms.  Against standard procedure, I actually brought in a pound of M&Ms in three different flavors (plain, peanut and crispy (which is crispy in the sense of Nestle Crunch bars: crisped rice)).  It feels fairly odd that I've already been here for a year.  I've done so much, but it also seems like I could have accomplished more.  I shouldn't really complain, there are others that started around the same time I did that haven't done much at all.  

There are actually a few people that have started recently (one started two years ago and two others started a year ago) that are leaving the company.  One is getting married, another is going to school and another is starting a company.  It should be publicly known, but Microsoft is reducing their benefits.

      Jeff took a look at my comparison post and asked about the units for the slalom course.  I knew it was MPH but Jeff reasoned that time through the course might be a better value to track.  I figured that average speed was used because different cars will have different acceleration rates, times through the course, speeds and more.  Just using time might be a better indication of cornering ability and power, not just cornering ability.  Anyway, I found this in one of my Motor Trend articles:  

Just drive around the cones as fast as your can, right?  Yes-and no.  Try cracking off six perfect, consecutive, emergency lane-changes at freeway speeds (some well above) with a margin of error at less than one inch.  Sure, this sound challenging until one realizes each cone arrives at less than a one second interval-the whole thing takes less than six seconds in these vehicles.  This is one test that best reveals a car's evil side.  A propensity to push, get loose, or even spin is ever more apparent while all four ties are howling at, in some cases, 80 MPH.  That's right, the speeds listed above are timed averages between the entry and exit markers along the 600-foot course-not how fast the car is actually traveling along its curvy line, which is, in fact, much faster.

      As you can tell from my last post, I have a new car!  Well, almost new.  Let me tell the story.  

About this time last year, I was car shopping.  I had almost signed on an Evo when better judgment told me to go with something cheaper to start.  Also, 271 HP is a bit much for someone that had never driven a manual before.  I decided to use my grandfathers Ford discount and just pick up a Focus.  It had decent looks and handling and the interior was fairly accomodating.  I have yet to find nicer seats (not even in the SVT).  While I was trying to pick out the Focus I wanted, the sales person I was working with kept mentioning the SVT.  When we finally went out to the dealer lot to grab an automatic ZX3 for a test drive, we had to pass over at least five SVTs to find a single ZX3.  Obviously the cars were not selling well.  

I bought the Camaro about two months ago and I've only put about 200 miles on it.  I wasn't getting any better at the manual, so I just stopped trying.  I'm always looking at car forums when the SVT was mentioned.  I cannot remember the context but someone was praising it on a Subaru forum.  A car has to be at least moderately respectable for someone entrenched in another manufacturer's camp to praise it.  Just on a whim, I decided to look up new/used SVTs in the area.  The only one I could find was a 2004 model with about 940 miles on it.  I figured that had to be a typo for 9,400 so I figured I'd email the dealer.  Nope, not a typo.  An older gentleman traded in a SVT Lightning for an SVT Focus and then decided it seemed too young for him.  He returned it 3 weeks later.  

They gave me an overnight test drive and I decided this is what my car should have been all along.  Tighter (but not punishing) suspension, better brakes, better looks, better acceleration and an amazing transmission.  Going to this car from the Camaro is very eye-opening.  The Getrag trans is just a thing of beauty.  I think the only better transmission out there for under $35k is in the S2000.  The dealership first put the car on the market at $19,995 (or just about what the car cost new) and that didn't fly.  The salesperson also offered me only $7,500 for the ZX3 and an interest rate of 7.49%.  Given those numbers, my monthly payment would have been $677.17!  The price of the car was talked down to $17,500 then $16,900 and finally $16,500.  The trade in on the ZX3 was brought up to $7,750 then $8,000 then $8,500.  The APR was brought down to 6.49%.  After the trade-in, loan payoff (of the ZX3), license, document fees (yeah WTF), taxes and $1,000 down, I had to finance $17,238.75.  With an APR of 6.49%, my monthly payment will only be $528.27.  

The more I drive this car, the more I love it.  I am not quite used to the 6-speed but I've had multiple people tell me I'm much smoother in the SVT than in the Camaro.  That is just a put-down in disguise but I'll take it anyway!

      Ok, now that I have a semi-respectible car, I'm thinking about taking it autocrossing.  Let me explain in case you have never heard of autocrossing.  Basically, a tight and twisty course is constructed of cones in a large parking lot.  You rarely go over 60 MPH so this is not a high speed sport.  It focuses on cornering and smooth driving.  I'm definitely not good enough with the manual to consider doing it this year but I plan on checking out a few events so that I know what to expect next summer.  Anyway, check out some of these  urlLink course maps  and you'll get a better idea.

      So little time or energy to post!  Suppa happy fun bullets are all you get.

 

 Kat and I didn't do much this Fourth of July weekend.  We both had difficult weeks (especially the night where I left work at 12:45 AM and then was up for the next day before 7 AM) so we just took it easy.  Her parents backyard overlooks much of Seattle so we were able to see four different fireworks displays at once (Elliot Bay, Gasworks, Yarrow Bay and Kirkland).

 Tonight was the second game of the summer FloorBurn season.  I'm captain already and I've already made a mistake.  I didn't inform everyone we had a game this week (assuming that the manager would take care of that like last season) and only 4 people showed up.  A couple people subbed for us and we ended up winning 3-1!  I almost had a hat trick but the pass I got right in front of the goal was actually about to go into the goal so I just let it go by!

 I've spent about eight hours working on my yearly review for Microsoft and I'm only about a third of the way completed.  It is important but not that important.  I just want a fatty raise so I can afford my new car and my $1,570/month rent.

 This happened two weekends ago, but Eric of Jenn&Eric fame was in town so Kat, Eric and I grabbed some dinner and dessert.  We had a good time, but it didn't last long enough.  I had an early morning appointment so I had to call the night around 9 PM.

 The new car is still super sweet.  To measure how sweet it is, I picked up a  urlLink G-Tech Performance Meter Pro .  I haven't had a chance to try it out yet.  Well, I haven't had a piece of flat, dry, non-cop-infested road to really wring out the car and measure with it yet.  In time.

 While the car is still super sweet, the oh-so-smooth shifter is becoming less smooth.  There is some hesitation as the shifter returns to neutral on the way to the next gear.  It almost seems like the linkage is jammed.  Oh well, it should work itself out in time otherwise it is going to the dealer!  I didn't drive this car hard at all yet and I haven't had a gear grind nor have I missed a shift.  If there is a problem, it wasn't my fault.

 I've been playing a ton of GT3 lately, now that Russ has moved out.  I can play the really long races or long sets of races and just leave the PS2 running while I go to work.  I can play a bit, do something else then go back to an unmolested PS2.  I've already won an F1 car so now it's basically a game of ""How many times can I pass everyone before I win!"".  I love that game.

      Now that I have the SVT Focus, I've put the Camaro up for sale.  I have so far only posted it in the Microsoft classifieds but anyone in the Puget Sound area can take a look at these.  I put the car up two weeks ago and I got a phone call last Wednesday:  

Her: I'm calling about the Camaro. 

Me:  Ok, it's still available. 

Her: Can I come see it? 

Me:  Sure, when works for you. 

Her: How about this weekend? 

Me:  Ok, when? 

Her: Oh, I don't know, lunchtime?  

At this point, I got a little bit frustrated.  I dont want to hear ""lunchtime"", I want a specific time and date.  Anyway, I finally got her to decide on Saturday at noon.  She calls me Friday morning (a call I missed since I was in the parking garage) and says that she can't do it on Saturday and that Sunday at 5 PM would work better.  Ok, that is fine.  I get a voicemail Sunday at roughly 4 PM to say she can't make it at 5 PM and would Monday work.   I call her back, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying that Monday would be fine if she would please tell me a specific time.   She emails me this morning to say that either 6 or 7 PM would work.  I told her to give me a specific time and if she was going to change that time to tell me by 2 PM.  She writes back, saying 7 PM would be fine.   Here we are, 5:30 PM and she calls:  

Her: Hi Mike, I just wanted to see if we could meet earlier. 

Me:  Well, we decided on 7 PM. 

Her: I know, but I was wondering if we could meet at 6 or 6:30 PM. 

Me:  I already said that I would need to know by 2 PM if you were going to change the time. 

Her: I know, I was just wondering if you could get off work early. 

Me:  No, but 7 PM works for me. 

Her: Ok. 

Me:  (Cutting her off) Bye.  ::CLICK:: 

Holy cow.  I bet you $100 that she is going to show up 15 minutes late and then not know how to drive a manual transmission.  Just wait. 

UPDATE:  She can't drive a manual!   But, this is a car for her (I think) younger brother so I will give her a little slack.

      Sigh, I hate moving.  Russ gave me not quite enough notice to find a roommate so I'm moving out.  I even paid the entire rent plus the month-to-month penalty plus the extra parking spot for a month hoping I would find someone.  No such luck.  

Katherine has graciously offered living with her for a short while until I find someone else to room with.  I am going to move the majority of my stuff into a storage unit and move the necessities over to her townhome.  Actually, I've already moved most of my hanged clothes and shoes.  Over the weekend, I hope to pack up everything so that I can get a mover next week to bring it all to a storage unit.  No way am I going to try to move my couch, queen bed, bookshelves et cetera by myself.  

The real kicker here is that I didn't give my apartment enough notice that I was leaving.  When I went from the year lease to a month-to-month lease, they never said anything about a ""twenty day notice"".  On a month-to-month, that's a huge amount of notice!  I wanted to move out at the end of July but they are so graciously allowing me to pay $1470 for all of August.  They said that if someone moves into the apartment, they will pro-rate the amount and pay me back.  I somehow doubt that is going to happen!  Sigh.

      Ok, really weird dream.  Here are some of the highlights:

 

 Set in a time where USA and the Soviet Union are at a full-on war.

 The first part of the dream sees me running across an American battlefield, trying to avoid bullets, mines, bombs, missiles and just about every other type of munition.

 I saw a very large passenger jet, presumably American, get hit by a missle and then crash into the sea.  This jet was filled with Olympic athletes.

 At this point, the dream becomes more of a movie and I am delegated to observer status.

 A rag-tag group of Americans decide that the only way to stop the Soviet Union is to infiltrate their country and kill their leader.  The group of Americans consist of a female Olympic judge, a 12-year-old girl and an older guy that looks like James Earl Jones.

 This group has to train to be able to infiltrate the country.  Instead of learning military techniques, they learn how to train water snakes.

 I don't remember how, but all of a sudden the entire group is in the heart of the Soviet Union.  The unnamed leader is hiding out in a rural town in a boarding house.

 The little girl sneaks upstairs, undetected, to find the leader sleeping amongst 15 other people from the town. The girl places a rag of some sort of chemical over the leaders mouth, knocking him out.  Instead of just killing him, the girl saws off his head with a dull machete and puts it into a burlap bag.  No one has yet noticed anything has happened.  She sneaks downstairs and runs outside.

 Just as she joins the rest of her group hiding behind a bush outside, there is a sound much like the sharpening of a machete.  From an open window upstairs, the now-dead body of the leader with a ghostly head starts to appear in the window.  At first, it's safe to assume he is about to brandish a machete when instead he pulls out a .50 cal machine gun (the type that is normally truck mounted).  Before he can fire, the James Earl Jones character grabs a gun from the ground and sprays the leader with bullets.

 The end.

      Quick post again.   

I went to a RallyCross on Sunday ( urlLink pictures ).  It was fairly interesting, but I'm not subjecting my only car to that treatment.  Today I got my new Microsoft Prime card (discount card for restaurants, hotels, etc).  The old design was fairly metrosexual (polka dots and all) but the new one takes the cake!

      Every day should be a half day.  Took the afternoon off to hit the dentist, and while I was out I managed to get my oil changed, too.  Remember that business with my car dealership this winter?  Well, consider this the epilogue.  The friendly fellas at the Valvoline Instant Oil Change on Snelling were nice enough to notice that my dipstick was broken, and the metal piece was too far down in its little dipstick tube to pull out.  Looks like I'm going to need a magnet.   Damn you, Kline Nissan, daaaaaaammmnnn yooouuuu....   Today I let my boss know that I've submitted my Corps application.  The news has been greeted by everyone in the company with a level of enthusiasm that really floors me.     The back deck has finally been cleared off by the construction company working on the place.  This company, for anyone who's interested, consists mainly of one guy who spends his days cursing at his crew of Spanish-speaking laborers.  Construction of my deck began around the time Nixon was getting out of office.

      I'm still not making any headway with my family.  In fact, I think Mom has been rallying the troops (aka aunts and uncles) against me.  Meanwhile, my friends have been really supportive of the idea.  Thanks, all.  It's frustrating, you know?  Here, I want to get out into the world, have a pinch of adventure, and maybe help some people out in the process, and I'm earning the resentment of the entire freakin' family because of this.  I can only hope that, over time, cooler heads will prevail.  There's now a nationwide girlfriend hunt on for yours truly (hell, with Mom's Mexico ties, this shit could go international), because, obviously, the cure for all this foolishness is for me to get laid.  Oh, and I should buy myself something nice.  Problem solved.  Life is so sad.  Had a spot of Sunday night insomnia, fueled mostly by my discussions with the parents yesterday.  Thankfully, Jack Daniels helped me out with that.  Whoever is in charge of late night Sunday programming should be shot.  Sunday night insomnia is not an uncommon phenomenon, and TV needs to be there for people in their hour(s) of need!  Jerks.

      Two points for anyone who can identify that bit of dialogue (one of my favorite bits).  Hint: Director Steven Soderbergh insists that it's meaningless.  Back to  About Schmidt  for a moment.  I just love the name Schmidt.  Does anyone else feel the same way?  So many superfluous letters... that kooky ""c""... that silent ""d"".  Along those same lines: it took Michael Moore to really help me memorize the spelling of ""Fahrenheit"".  Yes, I'm still adhering to my own rule that periods don't need to go inside quotation marks.  The parents are on their way out.  I'm going to try to think of something to cook, lest we end up at Axl's Bonfire Grill down the street.  Let me see... corn on the cob fresh from my grimy stove-top, or perhaps a nice walleye salad at Axl's?  Decisions, decisions.

       About Schmidt  this afternoon.  Pretty good.  A little vexed by the ending.  I think I'm getting too lazy to interpret ambiguity.  Finished up most of my application today, essay questions and all.  All that remains is to inform my references of their reference status... and that could very well mean letting my company know that I'm planning to leave in 6 mos. to a year.  I'm not sure how they'll react, but I'm not all that concerned, either.  Good people there, certainly, but I am giving them at least  six months  notice.  At this point, the only thing that gives me pause is Sydney.  I have to make sure she has a home for a few years, and I have to be sure that whoever gets her knows what they're getting into.  Sydney's a good cat in a lot of ways... very clean, very well mannered, sweet as all get out... and that tiny meow.  That said, she likes to scratch stuff, and I should probably get that in check before I expose her to furniture that isn't dorm-rated.

      I spent a good hour last night paging through the application and making little notes about what to say for the longer, essay portions.  The questions being asked are standard job interview stuff, at least they were at the University.  Basically, how do you handle diversity, and why do you want to work here?  As for the short answers: I haven't decided whether I should be concerned by the fact that there's an entire page dedicated to previous volunteer experience... and, apart from a pledge that I'm going to be doing some tutoring work for the Minnesota Literacy Council, that page is going to be completely blank.  The job history page says to go back ""at least 10 years.""  Ten years ago, I was 16.  I was working at Best Buy, and I hated it.  I should note, though, that I saw my old manager working at Audio King (back when it was called Audio King), many months ago.  Then there was Media Play... then Hollywood Video... I can't believe that an international aid organization would find my ability to upsell Packard Bells, or say in what section  Femalien  resides, remotely interesting.  How I spent the remainder of my Thursday night: Watched  The Fog of War , an amazing Errol Morris doc about Robert McNamara.  Then, I went to sleep and had strange dreams involving Holly Hunter.

      It's pretty obvious that I'm not a great learner of lessons, because here I am writing the umpteeth ""first blog entry"" of my life.  Someone, somewhere (probably pretty close to here, actually), is going to open up this domain expecting to see handsome video game Cratchit digging his way out of a sand trap, only to find I'm on the blogging track again.  Cue blood squib explosions and the first movement of Carmina Burana.  But, wait.  I'm a changed man, baby!  Things will be different this time, I swear!  Well, maybe not right away, but eventually, I hope.  I've been feeling more than a little anxious the past few months.  Life as a web developer has sort of burned me out, and I think I'd like to try something different... something that will get me closer the Great Life Goal I'm shooting for.  I'm not sure what the Goal is exactly, but I get the feeling I'll never get there on my current course.  Web development is great and all, but sometimes I get the impression that, in this field, I'm driven more by my perfectionism than by any genuine love of the work.  It's no secret to anyone that's spoken to me in the past few months that I'm about this (--) close to joining the Peace Corps.  In fact, the application is sitting on my coffee table right now.  There's a pen there, too.  Oh, and I've filled in a few blanks with that very same pen.  There are a few very big blanks that are going to demand more brainpower than I can muster after 8-something hours of mind-numbing development, but I promise you that I'm going to power through and get all 16+ pages of the form in the mail by the end of next week.  I'm sure even my fans in Chicago will be able to hear my mother's cries when she hears the news.  So, you see, this blog has a reason for existing.  I'm hitting the reset button on life, and you're all going to be here to see it.  Dramatic, right?  Anyway, here we go.

      My reference forms trickled in last week, and that left the weekend for me to buck up my cross-cultural adaptation essay, something I've been really struggling with.  What's a significant experience  you've  had with adapting to a different culture?  You'd think that a three month stint in Europe would make a question of this kind really easy to answer, but it doesn't... tourism, as it turns out, doesn't really lend itself to forcing you adapt to anything other than washing your clothes in a sink.  I wish I could say I've needed to wipe my butt with a leaf once in my life, but that's just not the case... hence, my application to the PC.    Back to the story, then.  I filled up the huge PC envelope last night and sent it on its way this morning.  There's an education addendum that I decided against filling out, only because it would have been a pretty pathetic-looking effort.  My IT addendum, on the other hand, was five pages long.  Huzzah!  I'd still rather not spend two years sitting in front of a computer in Whateverstan, but I don't want to limit my placement opportunities, either.    So that's that.  Now I wait for a nomination.    On the 'rents:  This weekend, I told them that I've submitted my application and met with a recruiter.  Their heads didn't explode.  They didn't key my car or light my hair on fire.  Still, Dad says that I'm making a mistake, and Mom said she wouldn't be able to sleep.  I stressed the importance of optimism, as opposed to--well, you know--flipped-out, irrational fatalism.    DNC:  Politics.  Feh.  Here's my take on politics:   Dear Republicans:  George W. Bush...  This is the best you've got?  Are you fucking serious?  Dear Democrats:  John Kerry...  This is the best you've got?  Are you fucking serious?     That is all.  You may return to your regular business.

      Hey, I gave you guys a little vacation.  Hope you enjoyed it.    Met with my Peace Corps recruiter Friday afternoon at the PC office above Kieran's. Answered a bunch of those types of questions you get at job interviewsm, and was fingerprinted for my soon-to-be-generated FBI file. There goes my backup plan of becoming a jewel thief.    Managed to skirt around conversation relating to this on Sunday, when I visited the parents. Actually, I haven't yet told them that I've actually started the application process, only that I've been thinking seriously about it.    I probably would have gotten into it, but Mom called me on Thursday afternoon, loaded up with a bunch of anecdotes from the ""Casualties of Peace"" series of articles that ran in the Dayton Daily News last year. Arguing with your mother is a good way to ruin your lunch break, and many of the hours thereafter.    But I really should be going. Hoping to get the rest of my paperwork in this week. After that, I'll ready myself for a series of invasive medical check-ups. Joy!

      My parents have the week off work... so when the weekends just aren't enough time to argue about my decisions, now I can do that on Thursday mornings, too!  Something about social circles, I guess: my parents insist that everyone they talk to about my future excursion rolls their eyes at the idea, throws their hands up in the air and cries ""Why?!""  Perhaps they exaggerate.  My mother is a veritable encyclopedia of horror stories about international travel.  ""Didn't you hear about those people in Honduras two years ago that were tortured and killed?""  ""Didn't you hear about that couple in Mexico that they put in jail and wanted $10,000 from?  And the wife had appendicitis.  And then Satan bit their arms off, and smuggled them over the border... stuffed with cocaine!""  ""You don't want to go to Africa!  They have apartheid, and they like to kill white people!""  [rolls eyes]

      A recruiter called today, and I'm all set up to interview/be fingerprinted next Friday afternoon.  The recruiter also wants to flesh out one of my essay responses.  I wasn't altogether happy with my essays.  Like I've said before, my capacity for churning out long form answers that are semi-coherent has been damaged by one too many English classes over the years.  More often than not, I come off sounding like a damn moron... or maybe I always sounded that way, and all of those English classes just helped me to recognize my own moronitude.  Setback: I called today to register for ESL pre-training classes, but it turns out they were completely full for the month.  OK.  August, then.  Now I won't be able to sit down and actually tutor anyone until sometime in September.  Too many do-gooders in this world, I tell you.  This weekend: Friday, I did very little.  Saturday, I tried to see the Grand Excursion, but the boats were late, and it started to rain.  Plus, I didn't care.  Jer and I hooked up PSX controllers to the computer and played some old arcade games via MAME.  You know MAME, right?  Of course you do.  Everyone comes back to MAME once a year to remember just how bad most of the games were they drooled over years ago.  Remember ""Narc"" and ""Bad Dudes""?  Terrible, terrible games ( ""I'm bad!"" ).  ""Final Fight"" still seems decent, and thankfully shows that not  all  of those precious quarters were wasted.  Ahh, to be back in the K-mart arcade playing ""Altered Beast"" and ""Time Warriors""...  Sunday, I sat around some more.  While everyone else was watching fireworks, I was sitting through ""Fahrenheit 9-11"".  In a nutshell: I loved the first ten minutes, including the minimalist title sequence, and the eerie handling of 9-11.  Moore's naked contempt for G.W. is palatable when it's merely being insinuated.  It's less so when he refers to G.H.W. Bush as G.W.'s ""daddy""... but then I guess that's what political discourse has become in this country.  As with ""Bowling for Columbine"", Moore's film is most effective when read at arm's length.  Many of his facts are incorrect, and the things he infers can be completely unfair, but some of the broader strokes (such as our cozy relationship with Saudi Arabia, or the increased fear-mongering of the media in the past few years) invite discussion, which is probably a good thing.  Wild man Dan Nordquist has invited me to post on his new  urlLink video game blog .  See you there.

      Got a big pack of PC forms in the mail yesterday, including a few for my fingerprints.  With luck, I'll get an interview scheduled this week or next.  How are you doing?  I'm so happy to hear that!  Not feeling terribly motivated to get outside for some fireworks this evening.  I've been dead tired all day, to tell you the truth.  Spent some time out at my parents' place today, but Peace Corps didn't make the meeting agenda, so the Big News will have to wait a week.  Signed up for Google News Alerts about the Peace Corps today, just to keep my eye on things.  Bleh, I can't seem to eat anything that agrees with me these past few weeks.

      Until Genkai 1 is done! 
 
 Thanks to Shari's deft handling of getting the Genkai 1 alliance going on Friday/Saturday, our genkai experience was only mildly horrible instead of as excruciatingly horrible as it could have been.   
 
 On Friday, starting out with an alliance of 10 people that would eventually grow to 12 and then shrink back to five as the night went on, we managed to obtain 7/8 of the needed Exoray Molds in a mere 5 hours.  During this time we  somehow  (read: I blame everything on Dynastey)  managed to aggro nearly everything in the nest at least once, and in the case of Water Elementals - two or three times. 
 
 Saturday turned out better. On our trek to Eldeime Dyn only managed to aggro half of the mobs in the glacier -- A personal best!  Even with a smaller group than the night before, we were still able to dispatch anything that came our way.  In a mere four hours we were rewarded with 4/8 papyrus and only one death and level down.  It was just Shari, so it wasn't so bad. :) 
 
 The next outing for genkai items will probably be posted here, hopefully by Shari.  If not, check our  urlLink newly created forums  for more information.  Arrr! P)

      No XP fun was to be had last night as Shorty the Whm was MIA.  The rest of the Swashbucklers enjoyed individual pursuits that were generally successul.
 
    Sharkky  ran around the jungles of Yhoator trying to find a specific tree.  No word of whether or not he actually found his tree.  Search parties have been dispatched.   Dynastey  spent his time fishing until he realized that the moon was not in his favor, and then tried his luck at cooking dog food.  Your dog will need some Tums.   Shari  went off to level his lvl 6 Thf.  Armed with a stack of Mithkabobs and a toothpick, our intrepid Taru braved the wilds of Sarutabaruta and just might have realized the wonders of farming.  Could this be true?  The count on the ""Shari beg-o-meter"" has been reset. ^^;   Skellington  ran around the Maze of Shakrami in search of a new place to farm, and instead found many lowbies who died horrible deaths at the hands of linking bats.  Stonega should require a license to operate.   Tomorrow, Genkai madness!
